And there is a management named ACMC, a agent use it to manipulate informtions of users, prescripionts, orders, reviews and so on.<br /> We used jQuery Bootstrap-SASS and RequireJS to developed front-end modules of store site. And used AngularJS Bootstrap-SASS and RequireJS to developed front-end modules that are interfaced to REST of ACMC.<br /> This project has been experienced three phases. Phases 1 was intended to develop selling glasses online, I took on 60% front-end works. Phase ABB was intended to develope selling contact lenses, I took on 85% front-end works. Phase 2 was intented to develop integrating insurance. Whthin pahse 1, I took on 95% front-end works. Within pahse ABB, I took advantage of spare time to learned NodeJS, then optimized the script to build front-end codes, increased execution efficiency of gulp tasks. <br /> This project passed the test on WCAG 2.0 by an accredited third party Bender, all phases passed UAT and live online. And it as a standard project of the company.
