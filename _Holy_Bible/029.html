	<p><sup>1</sup>All Israel was listed in the genealogies recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. They were taken captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.</p>
	<section>
		<h4>The People in Jerusalem</h4>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Now the first to resettle on their own property in their own towns were some Israelites, priests, Levites and temple servants.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Those from Judah, from Benjamin, and from Ephraim and Manasseh who lived in Jerusalem were:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Uthai son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, a descendant of Perez son of Judah.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Of the Shelanites<a id="filepos3263640" href="030.html#filepos3451097"><sup>[67]</sup></a>:</p>
			<p>Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Of the Zerahites:</p>
			<p>Jeuel.</p>
			<p>The people from Judah numbered 690.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Of the Benjamites:</p>
			<p>Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah;</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Ibneiah son of Jeroham; Elah son of Uzzi, the son of Mikri; and Meshullam son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The people from Benjamin, as listed in their genealogy, numbered 956. All these men were heads of their families.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Of the priests:</p>
			<p>Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jakin;</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official in charge of the house of God;</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah; and Maasai son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>The priests, who were heads of families, numbered 1,760. They were able men, responsible for ministering in the house of God.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Of the Levites:</p>
			<p>Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, a Merarite; <sup>15</sup>Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal and Mattaniah son of Mika, the son of Zikri, the son of Asaph; <sup>16</sup>Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berekiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>The gatekeepers:</p>
			<p>Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman and their fellow Levites, Shallum their chief <sup>18</sup>being stationed at the King’s Gate on the east, up to the present time. These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites. <sup>19</sup>Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his fellow gatekeepers from his family (the Korahites) were responsible for guarding the thresholds of the tent just as their ancestors had been responsible for guarding the entrance to the dwelling of the LORD. <sup>20</sup>In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar was the official in charge of the gatekeepers, and the LORD was with him. <sup>21</sup>Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Altogether, those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. The gatekeepers had been assigned to their positions of trust by David and Samuel the seer. <sup>23</sup>They and their descendants were in charge of guarding the gates of the house of the LORD—the house called the tent of meeting. <sup>24</sup>The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north and south. <sup>25</sup>Their fellow Levites in their villages had to come from time to time and share their duties for seven-day periods. <sup>26</sup>But the four principal gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God. <sup>27</sup>They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service; they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out. <sup>29</sup>Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the special flour and wine, and the olive oil, incense and spices. <sup>30</sup>But some of the priests took care of mixing the spices. <sup>31</sup>A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with the responsibility for baking the offering bread. <sup>32</sup>Some of the Kohathites, their fellow Levites, were in charge of preparing for every Sabbath the bread set out on the table.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>Those who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible for the work day and night.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs as listed in their genealogy, and they lived in Jerusalem.</p>

		<h4>Saul Takes His Life</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. <sup>2</sup>The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. <sup>3</sup>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me.”</p>
		<p>But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. <sup>5</sup>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died. <sup>6</sup>So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. <sup>9</sup>They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people. <sup>10</sup>They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, <sup>12</sup>all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance, <sup>14</sup>and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood. <sup>2</sup>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’ ”</p>

		<h4>David Conquers Jerusalem</h4>
		<p><sup>4</sup>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there <sup>5</sup>said to David, “You will not get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David. <sup>8</sup>He built up the city around it, from the terraces<a id="filepos3278161" href="030.html#filepos3453090"><sup>[73]</sup></a> to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city. <sup>9</sup>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>David’s Mighty Warriors</h4>
		<p><sup>10</sup>These were the chiefs of David’s mighty warriors—they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised— <sup id="filepos3278920">11</sup>this is the list of David’s mighty warriors:</p>
		<p>Jashobeam,<a id="filepos3279092" href="030.html#filepos3453334"><sup>[74]</sup></a> a Hakmonite, was chief of the officers<a id="filepos3279217" href="030.html#filepos3453600"><sup>[75]</sup></a>; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors. <sup id="filepos3279580">13</sup>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. <sup>14</sup>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <sup>16</sup>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. <sup>17</sup>David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” <sup>18</sup>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD. <sup>19</sup>“God forbid that I should do this!” he said. “Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it.</p>
		<p>Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.</p>
		<p id="filepos3281137"><sup>20</sup>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. <sup>21</sup>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. <sup>23</sup>And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits<a id="filepos3281864" href="030.html#filepos3453962"><sup>[76]</sup></a> tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. <sup>24</sup>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. <sup>25</sup>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle; <sup>2</sup>they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin):</p>
		<blockquote title="indentedprose">
			<p><sup>3</sup>Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berakah, Jehu the Anathothite, <sup>4</sup>and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the Thirty, who was a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,<a id="filepos3290128" href="030.html#filepos3454361"><sup>[77]</sup></a> <sup id="filepos3290215">5</sup>Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite; <sup>6</sup>Elkanah, Ishiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites; <sup>7</sup>and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Ezer was the chief,</p>
			<p>Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Jeremiah the tenth and Makbannai the eleventh.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>14</sup>These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand. <sup>15</sup>It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold. <sup>17</sup>David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, I am ready for you to join me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge you.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Then the Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“We are yours, David!</p>
			<p>We are with you, son of Jesse!</p>
			<p>Success, success to you,</p>
			<p>and success to those who help you,</p>
			<p>for your God will help you.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Some of the tribe of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, “It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.”) <sup>20</sup>When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh. <sup>21</sup>They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army. <sup>22</sup>Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.<a id="filepos3294649" href="030.html#filepos3454785"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

		<h4>Others Join David at Hebron</h4>
		<p><sup>23</sup>These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, as the LORD had said:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>24</sup>from Judah, carrying shield and spear—6,800 armed for battle;</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>from Simeon, warriors ready for battle—7,100;</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>from Levi—4,600, <sup>27</sup>including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men, <sup>28</sup>and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>from Benjamin, Saul’s tribe—3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul’s house until then;</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>from Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans—20,800;</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>from half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king—18,000;</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>from Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do—200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>from Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, to help David with undivided loyalty—50,000;</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>from Naphtali—1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears;</p>
			<p><sup>35</sup>from Dan, ready for battle—28,600;</p>
			<p><sup>36</sup>from Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle—40,000;</p>
			<p><sup>37</sup>and from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon—120,000.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>38</sup>All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king. <sup>39</sup>The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them. <sup>40</sup>Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.</p>

		<h4>Bringing Back the Ark</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. <sup>2</sup>He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our people throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us. <sup>3</sup>Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of<a id="filepos3299415" href="030.html#filepos3455167"><sup>[79]</sup></a> it<a id="filepos3299504" href="030.html#filepos3455414"><sup>[80]</sup></a> during the reign of Saul.” <sup>4</sup>The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.</p>
		<p id="filepos3299752"><sup>5</sup>So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. <sup id="filepos3299950">6</sup>David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>They moved the ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it. <sup id="filepos3300399">8</sup>David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled. <sup>10</sup>The LORD’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Then David was angry because the LORD’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.<a id="filepos3301251" href="030.html#filepos3455652"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” <sup>13</sup>He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <sup>14</sup>The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he had.</p>

		<p><sup>8</sup>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went out to meet them. <sup>9</sup>Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim; <sup>10</sup>so David inquired of God: “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?”</p>
		<p>The LORD answered him, “Go, I will deliver them into your hands.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.<a id="filepos3304297" href="030.html#filepos3456307"><sup>[83]</sup></a> <sup>12</sup>The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Once more the Philistines raided the valley; <sup>14</sup>so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, “Do not go directly after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. <sup>15</sup>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.” <sup id="filepos3305025">16</sup>So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>So David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the LORD made all the nations fear him.</p>

		<h4>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. <sup>2</sup>Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it. <sup>4</sup>He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>5</sup>From the descendants of Kohath,</p>
			<p>Uriel the leader and 120 relatives;</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>from the descendants of Merari,</p>
			<p>Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives;</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>from the descendants of Gershon,<a id="filepos3307326" href="030.html#filepos3456713"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>
			<p>Joel the leader and 130 relatives;</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>from the descendants of Elizaphan,</p>
			<p>Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>from the descendants of Hebron,</p>
			<p>Eliel the leader and 80 relatives;</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>from the descendants of Uzziel,</p>
			<p>Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites. <sup>12</sup>He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. <sup>13</sup>It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way.” <sup>14</sup>So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup>15</sup>And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their fellow Levites as musicians to make a joyful sound with musical instruments: lyres, harps and cymbals.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berekiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah; <sup id="filepos3310116">18</sup>and with them their relatives next in rank: Zechariah,<a id="filepos3310183" href="030.html#filepos3456988"><sup>[85]</sup></a> Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel,<a id="filepos3310386" href="030.html#filepos3457484"><sup>[86]</sup></a> the gatekeepers.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; <sup id="filepos3310672">20</sup>Zechariah, Jaaziel,<a id="filepos3310704" href="030.html#filepos3457826"><sup>[87]</sup></a> Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to <i>alamoth,</i><a id="filepos3310897" href="030.html#filepos3458168"><sup>[88]</sup></a> <sup id="filepos3310984">21</sup>and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to <i>sheminith.</i><a id="filepos3311128" href="030.html#filepos3458417"><sup>[89]</sup></a> <sup>22</sup>Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark. <sup>24</sup>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing. <sup>26</sup>Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed. <sup>27</sup>Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the musicians, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod. <sup>28</sup>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.</p>

		<h4>Ministering Before the Ark</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. <sup>2</sup>After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. <sup>3</sup>Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to extol,<a id="filepos3314142" href="030.html#filepos3458789"><sup>[90]</sup></a> thank, and praise the LORD, the God of Israel: <sup id="filepos3314312">5</sup>Asaph was the chief, and next to him in rank were Zechariah, then Jaaziel,<a id="filepos3314398" href="030.html#filepos3459050"><sup>[91]</sup></a> Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel.

		<p><sup>7</sup>That day David first appointed Asaph and his associates to give praise to the LORD in this manner:</p>

			<p><sup>33</sup>Let the trees of the forest sing,</p>

			<p><sup>35</sup>Cry out, “Save us, God our Savior;</p>

		<p>Then all the people said “Amen” and “Praise the LORD.”</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister there regularly, according to each day’s requirements. <sup>38</sup>He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them.

		<p><sup>39</sup>David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon <sup>40</sup>to present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the LORD, which he had given Israel. <sup>41</sup>With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, “for his love endures forever.” <sup>42</sup>Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song.

			<p><sup>4</sup>“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in. <sup>5</sup>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day.

		<h4>David’s Victories</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought him tribute.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, in the vicinity of Hamath, when he went to set up his monument at<a id="filepos3336575" href="030.html#filepos3461186"><sup>[96]</sup></a> the Euphrates River. <sup id="filepos3336683">4</sup>David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them. <sup>6</sup>He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought him tribute. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. <sup id="filepos3337496">8</sup>From Tebah<a id="filepos3337518" href="030.html#filepos3461448"><sup>[97]</sup></a> and Kun, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, David took a great quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars and various bronze articles.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, <sup>10</sup>he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold, of silver and of bronze.</p>
		<p id="filepos3338242"><sup>11</sup>King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek.</p>
		<p id="filepos3338577"><sup>12</sup>Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. <sup>13</sup>He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.</p>

		<h4>David’s Officials</h4>
		<p><sup>14</sup>David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. <sup>15</sup>Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; <sup>16</sup>Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek<a id="filepos3339365" href="030.html#filepos3461721"><sup>[98]</sup></a> son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary; <sup id="filepos3339505">17</sup>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.</p>

		<h4>David Defeats the Ammonites</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king. <sup>2</sup>David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.</p>
		<p>When David’s envoys came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him, <sup>3</sup>the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven’t his envoys come to you only to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?” <sup>4</sup>So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved them, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents<a id="filepos3341509" href="030.html#filepos3462232"><sup>[99]</sup></a> of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim,<a id="filepos3341658" href="030.html#filepos3462503"><sup>[100]</sup></a> Aram Maakah and Zobah. <sup>7</sup>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maakah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. <sup>9</sup>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. <sup>11</sup>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites. <sup>12</sup>Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you. <sup>13</sup>Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. <sup>15</sup>When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. <sup id="filepos3344120">18</sup>But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak the commander of their army.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him.</p>
		<p>So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins. <sup>2</sup>David took the crown from the head of their king<a id="filepos3345439" href="030.html#filepos3462882"><sup>[101]</sup></a>—its weight was found to be a talent<a id="filepos3345568" href="030.html#filepos3463143"><sup>[102]</sup></a> of gold, and it was set with precious stones—and it was placed on David’s head.

		<p><sup>6</sup>In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. <sup>7</sup>When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.</p>

		<h4>David Counts the Fighting Men</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. <sup id="filepos3347841">2</sup>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. <sup>5</sup>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king’s command was repulsive to him. <sup>7</sup>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD said to Gad, David’s seer, <sup>10</sup>“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your choice: <sup id="filepos3350063">12</sup>three years of famine, three months of being swept away<a id="filepos3350131" href="030.html#filepos3463538"><sup>[103]</sup></a> before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human hands.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. <sup>15</sup>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah<a id="filepos3351473" href="030.html#filepos3463892"><sup>[104]</sup></a> the Jebusite.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>David said to God, “Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd,<a id="filepos3352133" href="030.html#filepos3464248"><sup>[105]</sup></a> have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? LORD my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people.”</p>

	<section>
		<h4>David Builds an Altar</h4>
		<p id="filepos3352601"><sup>18</sup>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. <sup>19</sup>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves. <sup>21</sup>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>David said to him, “Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price.”</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Araunah said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.”</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels<a id="filepos3354583" href="030.html#filepos3464653"><sup>[106]</sup></a> of gold for the site. <sup>26</sup>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. <sup>28</sup>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. <sup>29</sup>The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. <sup>30</sup>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>Preparations for the Temple</h4>
		<p><sup>2</sup>So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God. <sup>3</sup>He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. <sup>4</sup>He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it.” So David made extensive preparations before his death.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup>7</sup>David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God. <sup>8</sup>But this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. <sup>9</sup>But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon,<a id="filepos3358201" href="030.html#filepos3465050"><sup>[107]</sup></a> and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign. <sup>10</sup>He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>“Now, my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would. <sup>12</sup>May the LORD give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God. <sup>13</sup>Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents<a id="filepos3359538" href="030.html#filepos3465355"><sup>[108]</sup></a> of gold, a million talents<a id="filepos3359652" href="030.html#filepos3465634"><sup>[109]</sup></a> of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them. <sup>15</sup>You have many workers: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work <sup>16</sup>in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. <sup>18</sup>He said to them, “Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hands, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his people. <sup>19</sup>Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. <sup>3</sup>The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand. <sup>4</sup>David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work of the temple of the LORD and six thousand are to be officials and judges. <sup>5</sup>Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>David separated the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Gershonites</h4>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Belonging to the Gershonites:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Ladan and Shimei.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The sons of Ladan:</p>
			<p>Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel—three in all.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The sons of Shimei:</p>
			<p>Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran—three in all.</p>
			<p>These were the heads of the families of Ladan.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>And the sons of Shimei:</p>
			<p>Jahath, Ziza,<a id="filepos3363957" href="030.html#filepos3466038"><sup>[110]</sup></a> Jeush and Beriah.</p>
			<p>These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.</p>
			<p id="filepos3364284"><sup>11</sup>Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Kohathites</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The sons of Kohath:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four in all.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>The sons of Amram:</p>
			<p>Aaron and Moses.</p>
			<p>Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever. <sup>14</sup>The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>The sons of Moses:</p>
			<p>Gershom and Eliezer.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>The descendants of Gershom:</p>
			<p>Shubael was the first.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>The descendants of Eliezer:</p>
			<p>Rehabiah was the first.</p>
			<p>Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>The sons of Izhar:</p>
			<p>Shelomith was the first.</p>
			<p id="filepos3367032"><sup>19</sup>The sons of Hebron:</p>
			<p>Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>The sons of Uzziel:</p>
			<p>Micah the first and Ishiah the second.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Merarites</h4>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The sons of Merari:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Mahli and Mushi.</p>
			<p>The sons of Mahli:</p>
			<p>Eleazar and Kish.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>The sons of Mushi:</p>
			<p>Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth—three in all.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>24</sup>These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD. <sup>25</sup>For David had said, “Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever, <sup>26</sup>the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.” <sup>27</sup>According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God. <sup>29</sup>They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. <sup>30</sup>They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening <sup>31</sup>and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD.</p>

		<p><sup>6</sup>The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelek son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.</p>

		<p>These were the Levites, according to their families. <sup>31</sup>They also cast lots, just as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelek, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.</p>

		<h4>The Gatekeepers</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>The divisions of the gatekeepers:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>From the Korahites: Meshelemiah son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Meshelemiah had sons:</p>
			<p>Zechariah the firstborn,</p>
			<p>Jediael the second,</p>
			<p>Zebadiah the third,</p>
			<p>Jathniel the fourth,</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Elam the fifth,</p>
			<p>Jehohanan the sixth</p>
			<p>and Eliehoenai the seventh.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Obed-Edom also had sons:</p>
			<p>Shemaiah the firstborn,</p>
			<p>Jehozabad the second,</p>
			<p>Joah the third,</p>
			<p>Sakar the fourth,</p>
			<p>Nethanel the fifth,</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Ammiel the sixth,</p>
			<p>Issachar the seventh</p>
			<p>and Peullethai the eighth.</p>
			<p>(For God had blessed Obed-Edom.)</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Obed-Edom’s son Shemaiah also had sons, who were leaders in their father’s family because they were very capable men. <sup>7</sup>The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad; his relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also able men. <sup>8</sup>All these were descendants of Obed-Edom; they and their sons and their relatives were capable men with the strength to do the work—descendants of Obed-Edom, 62 in all.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Meshelemiah had sons and relatives, who were able men—18 in all.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Hosah the Merarite had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him the first), <sup>11</sup>Hilkiah the second, Tabaliah the third and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and relatives of Hosah were 13 in all.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>12</sup>These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their leaders, had duties for ministering in the temple of the LORD, just as their relatives had. <sup>13</sup>Lots were cast for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah.<a id="filepos3396014" href="030.html#filepos3468988"><sup>[118]</sup></a> Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and the lot for the North Gate fell to him. <sup>15</sup>The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-Edom, and the lot for the storehouse fell to his sons. <sup>16</sup>The lots for the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the upper road fell to Shuppim and Hosah.</p>
		<p>Guard was alongside of guard: <sup>17</sup>There were six Levites a day on the east, four a day on the north, four a day on the south and two at a time at the storehouse. <sup>18</sup>As for the court<a id="filepos3396722" href="030.html#filepos3469246"><sup>[119]</sup></a> to the west, there were four at the road and two at the court<a id="filepos3396871" href="030.html#filepos3469526"><sup>[120]</sup></a> itself.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>These were the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah and Merari.</p>

		<h4>The Treasurers and Other Officials</h4>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Their fellow Levites were<a id="filepos3397511" href="030.html#filepos3469806"><sup>[121]</sup></a> in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan and who were heads of families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli, <sup>22</sup>the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the temple of the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Shubael, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the official in charge of the treasuries. <sup>25</sup>His relatives through Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zikri his son and Shelomith his son. <sup>26</sup>Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and by the other army commanders. <sup>27</sup>Some of the plunder taken in battle they dedicated for the repair of the temple of the LORD. <sup>28</sup>And everything dedicated by Samuel the seer and by Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah, and all the other dedicated things were in the care of Shelomith and his relatives.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were assigned duties away from the temple, as officials and judges over Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his relatives—seventeen hundred able men—were responsible in Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the king’s service. <sup>31</sup>As for the Hebronites, Jeriah was their chief according to the genealogical records of their families. In the fortieth year of David’s reign a search was made in the records, and capable men among the Hebronites were found at Jazer in Gilead. <sup>32</sup>Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred relatives, who were able men and heads of families, and King David put them in charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.</p>
