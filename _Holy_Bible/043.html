	<p>A psalm.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.</p>
		<p id="filepos5137567"><sup>2</sup>The LORD has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn—shout for joy before the LORD, the King.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy;</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>let them sing before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.</p>
		<p>He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.</p>

	<p>Of David. A psalm.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>I will sing of your love and justice; to you, LORD, I will sing praise.</p>

	<p>A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours out a lament before the LORD.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos5154466"><sup>1</sup>Hear my prayer, LORD; let my cry for help come to you.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress.</p>
		<p>Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>My heart is blighted and withered like grass;</p>
		<p>I forget to eat my food.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>My days are like the evening shadow;</p>
		<p>I wither away like grass.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>But you, LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD:</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>“The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>In the course of my life<a id="filepos5162997" href="045.html#filepos5613307"><sup>[252]</sup></a> he broke my strength; he cut short my days.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>So I said:</p>
		<p>“Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.</p>
		<p id="filepos5163820"><sup>25</sup>In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</p>
		<p>Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>But you remain the same, and your years will never end.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”</p>

	<p>Of David.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Praise the LORD, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Praise the LORD, my soul, and forget not all his benefits—</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD’s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children—</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Praise the LORD, my soul.</p>
		<p>LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>The LORD wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters.</p>
		<p>He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</p>
		<p id="filepos5176263"><sup>4</sup>He makes winds his messengers,<a id="filepos5176393" href="045.html#filepos5613674"><sup>[253]</sup></a> flames of fire his servants.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate—bringing forth food from the earth:</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>He made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>How many are your works, LORD!</p>
		<p>In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number—living things both large and small.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works—</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>I will sing to the LORD all my life;</p>
		<p>I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more.</p>

		<p><sup>2</sup>Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>you his servants, the descendants of Abraham, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
		<p id="filepos5192626"><sup>8</sup>He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations,</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>“To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.”</p>
		<p id="filepos5194041"><sup>12</sup>When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>“Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>and he sent a man before them—</p>
		<p>Joseph, sold as a slave.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Then Israel entered Egypt;</p>
		<p>Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>He sent darkness and made the land dark—for had they not rebelled against his words?</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</p>
		<p><sup>36</sup>Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</p>
		<p><sup>38</sup>Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>They asked, and he brought them quail; he fed them well with the bread of heaven.</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</p>
		<p><sup>44</sup>he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—</p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws.</p>

		<p>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Remember me, LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.<a id="filepos5209837" href="045.html#filepos5615100"><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his mighty power known.</p>
		<p id="filepos5210326"><sup>9</sup>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
		<p id="filepos5214936"><sup>22</sup>miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>So he said he would destroy them—had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>they aroused the LORD’s anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips.<a id="filepos5219574" href="045.html#filepos5615484"><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</p>
		<p><sup>36</sup>They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to false gods.</p>
		<p><sup>38</sup>They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</p>
		<p><sup>44</sup>Yet he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</p>
		<p><sup>46</sup>He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.</p>
		<p><sup>47</sup>Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</p>
