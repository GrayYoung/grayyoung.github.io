	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos191157">Nahum 1</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>A prophecy concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</p>
	<section>
		<h4>The LORD’s Anger Against Nineveh</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath.</p>
			<p>The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished.</p>
			<p>His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry.</p>
			<p>Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away.</p>
			<p>The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Who can withstand his indignation?</p>
			<p>Who can endure his fierce anger?</p>
			<p>His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
			<p>He cares for those who trust in him,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Whatever they plot against the LORD he will bring<a id="filepos8859190" href="#filepos8887698"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to an end; trouble will not come a second time.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble.<a id="filepos8859954" href="#filepos8888025"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>From you, Nineveh, has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and devises wicked plans.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>12</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be destroyed and pass away.</p>
			<p>Although I have afflicted you, Judah,</p>
			<p>I will afflict you no more.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away.”</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD has given a command concerning you, Nineveh:</p>
			<p>“You will have no descendants to bear your name.</p>
			<p>I will destroy the images and idols that are in the temple of your gods.</p>
			<p>I will prepare your grave, for you are vile.”</p>
			<p id="filepos8862911"><sup>15</sup>Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace!</p>
			<p>Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows.</p>
			<p>No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.<a id="filepos8863983" href="#filepos8888303"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos8864419"><sup>1</sup>An attacker advances against you, Nineveh.</p>
		<p>Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>The shields of the soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet.</p>
		<p>The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of juniper are brandished.<a id="filepos8866688" href="#filepos8889064"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares.</p>
		<p>They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Nineveh summons her picked troops, yet they stumble on their way.</p>
		<p>They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>It is decreed<a id="filepos8868609" href="#filepos8889362"><sup>[6]</sup></a> that Nineveh be exiled and carried away.</p>
		<p>Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away.</p>
		<p>“Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Plunder the silver!</p>
		<p>Plunder the gold!</p>
		<p>The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>She is pillaged, plundered, stripped!</p>
		<p>Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Where now is the lions’ den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>“I am against you,” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
		<p>“I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions.</p>
		<p>I will leave you no prey on the earth.</p>
		<p>The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”</p>

		<h4>Woe to Nineveh</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots!</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears!</p>
			<p>Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses—</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute,</p>
			<p>alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>“I am against you,” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
			<p>“I will lift your skirts over your face.</p>
			<p>I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>I will pelt you with filth,</p>
			<p>I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>All who see you will flee from you and say,</p>
			<p>‘Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?’</p>
			<p>Where can I find anyone to comfort you?”</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her?</p>
			<p>The river was her defense, the waters her wall.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Cush<a id="filepos8879492" href="#filepos8889753"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and Egypt were her boundless strength;</p>
			<p>Put and Libya were among her allies.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Yet she was taken captive and went into exile.</p>
			<p>Her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner.</p>
			<p>Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Look at your troops—they are all weaklings.</p>
			<p>The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed the bars of your gates.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses!</p>
			<p>Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork!</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down—they will devour you like a swarm of locusts.</p>
			<p>Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day—but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>King of Assyria, your shepherds<a id="filepos8885980" href="#filepos8890006"><sup>[8]</sup></a> slumber; your nobles lie down to rest.</p>
			<p>Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Nothing can heal you; your wound is fatal.</p>
			<p>All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?</p>
