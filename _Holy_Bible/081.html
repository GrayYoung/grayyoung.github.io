<h4>The Rich Man and Lazarus</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>At his gate was laid a beggar</span></span><span><span> named Lazarus, covered with sores</span></span>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table.</span></span><span><span> Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>“The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham,</span></span><span><span> have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things,</span></span><span><span> but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>“He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>for I have five brothers. Let him warn them,</span></span><span><span> so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses</span></span><span><span> and the Prophets;</span></span><span><span> let them listen to them.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘No, father Abraham,’</span></span><span><span> he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”</span></span></p>

<div>
<p><span>Sin, Faith, Duty</span></p>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Jesus said to his disciples: <span><span>“Things that cause people to stumble</span></span><span><span> are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span><span>It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones</span></span><span><span> to stumble.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>So watch yourselves.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“If your brother or sister</span></span><a id="filepos9840232" href="#filepos9949327"><sup>[55]</sup></a><span><span> sins against you, rebuke them;</span></span><span><span> and if they repent, forgive them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>He replied, <span><span>“If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,</span></span><span><span> you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>“Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me</span></span><span><span> while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Heals Ten Men With Leprosy</h4>
<p><sup>11</sup>Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. <sup>12</sup>As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy<a id="filepos9842707" href="#filepos9949669"><sup>[56]</sup></a> met him. They stood at a distance <sup>13</sup>and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>When he saw them, he said, <span><span>“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</span></span> And as they went, they were cleansed.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. <sup>16</sup>He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.</p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>Jesus asked, <span><span>“Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”</span></span>
<sup>19</sup>Then he said to him, <span><span>“Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Coming of the Kingdom of God</h4>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <span><span>“The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’</span></span><span><span> because the kingdom of God is in your midst.”</span></span><a id="filepos9844714" href="#filepos9949999"><sup>[57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Then he said to his disciples, <span><span>“The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man,</span></span><span><span> but you will not see it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>For the Son of Man in his day</span></span><a id="filepos9845462" href="#filepos9950248"><sup>[58]</sup></a><span><span> will be like the lightning,</span></span><span><span> which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>But first he must suffer many things</span></span><span><span> and be rejected</span></span><span><span> by this generation.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>“Just as it was in the days of Noah,</span></span><span><span> so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>“It was the same in the days of Lot.</span></span><span><span> People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>“It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>Remember Lot’s wife!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.”</span></span>
<span><sup>[36]</sup></span><a id="filepos9848307" href="#filepos9950521"><sup>[59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><sup>37</sup>“Where, Lord?” they asked.</p>
<p>He replied, <span><span>“Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</span></span></p>

<div>
<h4>The Parable of the Persistent Widow</h4>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. <sup>2</sup>He said: <span><span>“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice</span></span><span><span> against my adversary.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>And the Lord said, <span><span>“Listen to what the unjust judge says.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out</span></span><span><span> to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> comes,</span></span><span><span> will he find faith on the earth?”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h4>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: <span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>“Two men went up to the temple to pray,</span></span><span><span> one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>The Pharisee stood by himself</span></span><span><span> and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>I fast</span></span><span><span> twice a week and give a tenth</span></span><span><span> of all I get.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast</span></span><span><span> and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</span></span></p>
<h4>The Little Children and Jesus</h4>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. <sup>16</sup>But Jesus called the children to him and said, <span><span>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child</span></span><span><span> will never enter it.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Rich and the Kingdom of God</h4>
<p><sup>18</sup>A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why do you call me good?”</span></span> Jesus answered. <span><span>“No one is good—except God alone.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’</span></span><a id="filepos9854775" href="#filepos9950974"><sup>[60]</sup></a><span><span>”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>21</sup>“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <span><span>“You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor,</span></span><span><span> and you will have treasure in heaven.</span></span><span><span> Then come, follow me.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. <sup>24</sup>Jesus looked at him and said, <span><span>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!”</p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>“Truly I tell you,”</span></span> Jesus said to them, <span><span>“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come</span></span><span><span> eternal life.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</h4>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, <span><span>“We are going up to Jerusalem,</span></span><span><span> and everything that is written by the prophets</span></span><span><span> about the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> will be fulfilled.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>He will be delivered over to the Gentiles.</span></span><span><span> They will mock him, insult him and spit on him;</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>they will flog him</span></span><span><span> and kill him.</span></span><span><span> On the third day</span></span><span><span> he will rise again.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>34</sup>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</p>
<h4>A Blind Beggar Receives His Sight</h4>
<p><sup>35</sup>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup>36</sup>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. <sup>37</sup>They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, <span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></span></p>
<p>“Lord, I want to see,” he replied.</p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>Jesus said to him, <span><span>“Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”</span></span>
<sup>43</sup>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</span></p>

<h4>Zacchaeus the Tax Collector</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. <sup>2</sup>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. <sup>3</sup>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. <sup>4</sup>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, <span><span>“Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”</span></span>
<sup>6</sup>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup>All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.”</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”</p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Jesus said to him, <span><span>“Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</span></span>
<span><span><sup id="filepos9862329">10</sup></span></span><span><span>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Ten Minas</h4>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. <sup>12</sup>He said: <span><span>“A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>So he called ten of his servants</span></span><span><span> and gave them ten minas.</span></span><a id="filepos9863237" href="#filepos9951463"><sup>[61]</sup></a><span><span> ‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>“But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span><span>“He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>“The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘Well done, my good servant!’</span></span><span><span> his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>“The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>“His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>“His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words,</span></span><span><span> you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>“He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</h4>
<p><span><sup>28</sup>After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. <sup>29</sup>As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, <span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>“Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. <sup>33</sup>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>They replied, “The Lord needs it.”</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. <sup>36</sup>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><sup>38</sup>“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a id="filepos9869806" href="#filepos9951732"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p>“Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>39</sup>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>40</sup></span></span><span><span>“I tell you,”</span></span> he replied, <span><span>“if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>41</sup>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it <sup>42</sup>and said, <span><span>“If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>43</sup></span></span><span><span>The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.</span></span><span><span> They will not leave one stone on another,</span></span><span><span> because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming</span></span><span><span> to you.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus at the Temple</h4>
<p><sup>45</sup>When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. <span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>“It is written,”</span></span> he said to them, <span><span>“ ‘My house will be a house of prayer’</span></span><a id="filepos9872184" href="#filepos9952023"><sup>[63]</sup></a><span><span>;</span></span><span><span> but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’</span></span><a id="filepos9872404" href="#filepos9952313"><sup>[64]</sup></a><span><span>”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>47</sup>Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. <sup>48</sup>Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</p>

<h4>The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. <sup>2</sup>“Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?”</p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>He replied, <span><span>“I will also ask you a question. Tell me:</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>John’s baptism</span></span><span><span>—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ <sup>6</sup>But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.”</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Jesus said, <span><span>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span></span></p>

<p><span><sup>9</sup>He went on to tell the people this parable: <span><span>“A man planted a vineyard,</span></span><span><span> rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love;</span></span><span><span> perhaps they will respect him.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>“But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span><span>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>He will come and kill those tenants</span></span><span><span> and give the vineyard to others.”</span></span></span></p>
<p>When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, <span><span>“Then what is the meaning of that which is written:</span></span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span>“ ‘The stone the builders rejected</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>has become the cornerstone’</span></span><a id="filepos9878095" href="#filepos9952716"><sup>[65]</sup></a><span><span>?</span></span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</p>
<h4>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h4>
<p><sup>20</sup>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. <sup>21</sup>So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. <sup>22</sup>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>He saw through their duplicity and said to them, <span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”</span></span></p>
<p>“Caesar’s,” they replied.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s,</span></span><span><span> and to God what is God’s.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>26</sup>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</p>
<h4>The Resurrection and Marriage</h4>
<p><sup>27</sup>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. <sup>28</sup>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. <sup>29</sup>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. <sup>30</sup>The second <sup>31</sup>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. <sup>32</sup>Finally, the woman died too. <sup>33</sup>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?”</p>
<p><span><sup>34</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come</span></span><span><span> and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children,</span></span><span><span> since they are children of the resurrection.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>37</sup></span></span><span><span>But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</span></span><a id="filepos9882522" href="#filepos9953007"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
<span><span><sup>38</sup></span></span><span><span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>39</sup>Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” <sup>40</sup>And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p>
<p><span>Whose Son Is the Messiah?</span></p>
<p><span><sup>41</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span><span>“Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>David himself declares in the Book of Psalms:</span></span></span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span>“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>“Sit at my right hand</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span><sup>43</sup></span></span><span><span>until I make your enemies</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>a footstool for your feet.” ’</span></span><a id="filepos9884419" href="#filepos9953296"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”</span></span></p>
<h4>Warning Against the Teachers of the Law</h4>
<p><span><sup>45</sup>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, <span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>“Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</span></span>
<span><span><sup id="filepos9885465">47</sup></span></span><span><span>They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”</span></span></span></p>

<div id="filepos9885700">
<h3><a href="004.html#filepos209368">Luke 21</a></h3>
<div>
<p><span>The Widow’s Offering</span></p>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. <sup>2</sup>He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. <span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>“Truly I tell you,”</span></span> he said, <span><span>“this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times</h4>
<p><sup>5</sup>Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, <span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another;</span></span><span><span> every one of them will be thrown down.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup>“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”</p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>He replied: <span><span>“Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>Then he said to them: <span><span>“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>“But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>And so you will bear testimony to me.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span><span>For I will give you</span></span><span><span> words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends,</span></span><span><span> and they will put some of you to death.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>Everyone will hate you because of me.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>But not a hair of your head will perish.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>Stand firm, and you will win life.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>“When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies,</span></span><span><span> you will know that its desolation is near.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>For this is the time of punishment</span></span><span><span> in fulfillment</span></span><span><span> of all that has been written.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled</span></span><span><span> on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>“There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>At that time they will see the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> coming in a cloud</span></span><span><span> with power and great glory.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>He told them this parable: <span><span>“Look at the fig tree and all the trees.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God</span></span><span><span> is near.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>“Truly I tell you, this generation</span></span><span><span> will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>“Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life,</span></span><span><span> and that day will close on you suddenly</span></span><span><span> like a trap.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>Be always on the watch, and pray</span></span><span><span> that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>37</sup>Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, <sup id="filepos9894864">38</sup>and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.</p>

<h4>Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, <sup>2</sup>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. <sup>3</sup>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. <sup>4</sup>And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. <sup>5</sup>They were delighted and agreed to give him money. <sup>6</sup>He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</p>
<h4>The Last Supper</h4>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. <sup>8</sup>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span><span>“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup>“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.</p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>He replied, <span><span>“As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>13</sup>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. <sup>15</sup>And he said to them, <span><span>“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, <span><span>“Take this and divide it among you.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <span><span>“This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, <span><span>“This cup is the new covenant</span></span><span><span> in my blood, which is poured out for you.</span></span><a id="filepos9899108" href="#filepos9953701"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>The Son of Man</span></span><span><span> will go as it has been decreed.</span></span><span><span> But woe to that man who betrays him!”</span></span>
<sup>23</sup>They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to them, <span><span>“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest,</span></span><span><span> and the one who rules like the one who serves.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>And I confer on you a kingdom,</span></span><span><span> just as my Father conferred one on me,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom</span></span><span><span> and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked</span></span><span><span> to sift all of you as wheat.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>But I have prayed for you,</span></span><span><span> Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>33</sup>But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Jesus answered, <span><span>“I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>35</sup>Then Jesus asked them, <span><span>“When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,</span></span><span><span> did you lack anything?”</span></span></p>
<p>“Nothing,” they answered.</p>
<p><span><sup>36</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</span></span>
<span><span><sup id="filepos9903006">37</sup></span></span><span><span>It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’</span></span><a id="filepos9903144" href="#filepos9954008"><sup>[69]</sup></a><span><span>;</span></span><span><span> and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>38</sup>The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.”</p>
<p><span><span>“That’s enough!”</span></span> he replied.</p>
<h4>Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives</h4>
<p><span><sup>39</sup>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. <sup>40</sup>On reaching the place, he said to them, <span><span>“Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<sup>41</sup>He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, <span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup</span></span><span><span> from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”</span></span>
<sup id="filepos9904598">43</sup>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. <sup id="filepos9904670">44</sup>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<a id="filepos9904791" href="#filepos9954299"><sup>[70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><sup>45</sup>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. <span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why are you sleeping?”</span></span> he asked them. <span><span>“Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”</span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Arrested</h4>
<p><sup>47</sup>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, <sup>48</sup>but Jesus asked him, <span><span>“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup>When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” <sup>50</sup>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</p>
<p><sup>51</sup>But Jesus answered, <span><span>“No more of this!”</span></span> And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.</p>
<p><span><sup>52</sup>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, <span><span>“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>53</sup></span></span><span><span>Every day I was with you in the temple courts,</span></span><span><span> and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour</span></span><span><span>—when darkness reigns.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Peter Disowns Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>54</sup>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. <sup>55</sup>And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. <sup>56</sup>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”</p>
<p><sup>57</sup>But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.</p>
<p><sup>58</sup>A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”</p>
<p>“Man, I am not!” Peter replied.</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.”</p>
<p><span><sup>60</sup>Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. <sup>61</sup>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: <span><span>“Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”</span></span>
<sup>62</sup>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></p>
<h4>The Guards Mock Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>63</sup>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. <sup>64</sup>They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” <sup>65</sup>And they said many other insulting things to him.</p>
<h4>Jesus Before Pilate and Herod</h4>
<p><sup>66</sup>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. <sup>67</sup>“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.”</p>
<p><span>Jesus answered, <span><span>“If I tell you, you will not believe me,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>68</sup></span></span><span><span>and if I asked you, you would not answer.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>69</sup></span></span><span><span>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>70</sup>They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”</p>
<p>He replied, <span><span>“You say that I am.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>71</sup>Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.”</p>

<h3><a href="004.html#filepos209724">Luke 23</a></h3>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. <sup>2</sup>And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.”</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p><span><span>“You have said so,”</span></span> Jesus replied.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.”</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. <sup>7</sup>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. <sup>9</sup>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. <sup>10</sup>The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. <sup>11</sup>Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. <sup>12</sup>That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, <sup>14</sup>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. <sup>15</sup>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. <sup>16</sup>Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.” <sup>[17]</sup><a id="filepos9913987" href="#filepos9954802"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>18</sup>But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” <sup>19</sup>(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. <sup>21</sup>But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.”</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. <sup>24</sup>So Pilate decided to grant their demand. <sup>25</sup>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</p>
<h4>The Crucifixion of Jesus</h4>
<p><span><sup>26</sup>As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. <sup>27</sup>A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. <sup>28</sup>Jesus turned and said to them, <span><span>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>Then</span></span></span></p>

<br/><p><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. <sup>33</sup>When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. <sup>34</sup>Jesus said, <span><span>“Father,</span></span><span><span> forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”</span></span><a id="filepos9917760" href="#filepos9955496"><sup>[73]</sup></a> And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar <sup>37</sup>and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>There was a written notice above him, which read: <span><span>THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</span></span>.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? <sup>41</sup>We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.<a id="filepos9919459" href="#filepos9955771"><sup>[74]</sup></a>”</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Jesus answered him, <span><span>“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</span></span></p>
<h4>The Death of Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>44</sup>It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, <sup>45</sup>for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. <sup>46</sup>Jesus called out with a loud voice, <span><span>“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”</span></span><a id="filepos9920358" href="#filepos9956048"><sup>[75]</sup></a> When he had said this, he breathed his last.</p>
<p><sup>47</sup>The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.” <sup>48</sup>When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. <sup>49</sup>But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>
<h4>The Burial of Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>50</sup>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, <sup>51</sup>who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. <sup>52</sup>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. <sup>53</sup>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. <sup>54</sup>It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</p>
<p><sup>55</sup>The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. <sup>56</sup>Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</p>

<h3><a href="004.html#filepos209902">Luke 24</a></h3>
<div>
<h4>Jesus Has Risen</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup>2</sup>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup>3</sup>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup>4</sup>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup>5</sup>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup>6</sup>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>‘The Son of Man</span></span><span><span> must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’</span></span> ” <sup>8</sup>Then they remembered his words.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup>10</sup>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup>11</sup>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup>12</sup>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</p>
<h4>On the Road to Emmaus</h4>
<p><sup>13</sup>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles<a id="filepos9924422" href="#filepos9956452"><sup>[76]</sup></a> from Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup>15</sup>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup>16</sup>but they were kept from recognizing him.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He asked them, <span><span>“What are you discussing together as you walk along?”</span></span></p>
<p>They stood still, their faces downcast. <sup>18</sup>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>“What things?”</span></span> he asked.</p>
<p>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. <sup>20</sup>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup>21</sup>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup>22</sup>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup>23</sup>but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup>24</sup>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”</p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”</span></span>
<sup>27</sup>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. <sup>29</sup>But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup>31</sup>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup>32</sup>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup>34</sup>and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” <sup>35</sup>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</p>
<h4>Jesus Appears to the Disciples</h4>
<p><sup>36</sup>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, <span><span>“Peace be with you.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>37</sup>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup>38</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>39</sup></span></span><span><span>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see;</span></span><span><span> a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>40</sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup>41</sup>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, <span><span>“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span></span>
<sup>42</sup>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup>43</sup>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</span></p>
<p><sup>44</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“This is what I told you while I was still with you:</span></span><span><span> Everything must be fulfilled</span></span><span><span> that is written about me in the Law of Moses,</span></span><span><span> the Prophets</span></span><span><span> and the Psalms.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>45</sup>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup>46</sup>He told them, <span><span>“This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer</span></span><span><span> and rise from the dead on the third day,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>47</sup></span></span><span><span>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name</span></span><span><span> to all nations,</span></span><span><span> beginning at Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>48</sup></span></span><span><span>You are witnesses</span></span><span><span> of these things.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>49</sup></span></span><span><span>I am going to send you what my Father has promised;</span></span><span><span> but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Ascension of Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>50</sup>When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup>51</sup>While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup>52</sup>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup id="filepos9931811">53</sup>And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</p>
