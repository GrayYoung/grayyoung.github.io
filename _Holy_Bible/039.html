	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Blessed is the one</p>
		<p>who does not walk in step with the wicked</p>
		<p>or stand in the way that sinners take</p>
		<p>or sit in the company of mockers,</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,</p>
		<p>and who meditates on his law day and night.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,</p>
		<p>which yields its fruit in season</p>
		<p>and whose leaf does not wither—</p>
		<p>whatever they do prospers.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Not so the wicked!</p>
		<p>They are like chaff</p>
		<p>that the wind blows away.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,</p>
		<p>nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous,</p>
		<p>but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.</p>

		<p>and I destroyed my foes.</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—</p>
		<p>to the LORD, but he did not answer.</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>I beat them as fine as windblown dust;</p>
		<p>I trampled them<a id="filepos4516627" href="045.html#filepos5541270"><sup>[41]</sup></a> like mud in the streets.</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>You have delivered me from the attacks of the people;</p>

		<p>Exalted be God my Savior!</p>
		<p><sup>47</sup>He is the God who avenges me,</p>
		<p>who subdues nations under me,</p>
		<p><sup>48</sup>who saves me from my enemies.</p>
		<p>You exalted me above my foes;</p>

		<p>Why are you so far from saving me,</p>
		<p>so far from my cries of anguish?</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,</p>

		<p>in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>But I am a worm and not a man,</p>
		<p>scorned by everyone, despised by the people.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>All who see me mock me;</p>
		<p>they hurl insults, shaking their heads.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>“He trusts in the LORD,” they say,</p>
		<p>“let the LORD rescue him.</p>
		<p>Let him deliver him,</p>
		<p>since he delights in him.”</p>

		<p>from my mother’s womb you have been my God.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Do not be far from me,</p>

		<p>strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Roaring lions that tear their prey</p>
		<p>open their mouths wide against me.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>I am poured out like water,</p>
		<p>and all my bones are out of joint.</p>
		<p>My heart has turned to wax;</p>

		<p>You are my strength; come quickly to help me.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Deliver me from the sword,</p>
		<p>my precious life from the power of the dogs.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;</p>
		<p>save me from the horns of the wild oxen.</p>
		<p id="filepos4547620"><sup>22</sup>I will declare your name to my people;</p>
		<p>in the assembly I will praise you.</p>

		<p>the suffering of the afflicted one;</p>
		<p>he has not hidden his face from him</p>

		<p><sup>25</sup>From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;</p>

		<p><sup>27</sup>All the ends of the earth</p>
		<p>will remember and turn to the LORD,</p>
		<p>and all the families of the nations</p>
		<p>will bow down before him,</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>for dominion belongs to the LORD</p>
		<p>and he rules over the nations.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;</p>
		<p>all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—</p>
