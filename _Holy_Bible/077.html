		<h4>Joseph Accepts Jesus as His Son</h4>
		<p id="filepos9107729"><sup>18</sup>This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about<a id="filepos9107858" href="078.html#filepos9404305"><sup>[4]</sup></a>: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. <sup>19</sup>Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet<a id="filepos9108155" href="078.html#filepos9404584"><sup>[5]</sup></a> did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. <sup>21</sup>She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,<a id="filepos9108747" href="078.html#filepos9404841"><sup>[6]</sup></a> because he will save his people from their sins.”</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: <sup>23</sup>“The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”<a id="filepos9109183" href="078.html#filepos9405184"><sup>[7]</sup></a> (which means “God with us”).</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. <sup>25</sup>But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p>

		<h4>The Magi Visit the Messiah</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi<a id="filepos9110156" href="078.html#filepos9405589"><sup>[8]</sup></a> from the east came to Jerusalem <sup>2</sup>and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. <sup>4</sup>When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. <sup>5</sup>“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>6</sup>“ ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’<a id="filepos9111589" href="078.html#filepos9405841"><sup>[9]</sup></a>”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. <sup>8</sup>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. <sup>10</sup>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. <sup>11</sup>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. <sup>12</sup>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Escape to Egypt</h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, <sup>15</sup>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<a id="filepos9113608" href="078.html#filepos9406182"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. <sup>17</sup>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>18</sup>“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning,</p>
			<p>Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”<a id="filepos9114943" href="078.html#filepos9406470"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4>The Return to Nazareth</h4>
		<p><sup>19</sup>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt <sup>20</sup>and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. <sup>22</sup>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, <sup>23</sup>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea <sup>2</sup>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” <sup>3</sup>This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,</p>
			<p>‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ”<a id="filepos9117266" href="078.html#filepos9406875"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>4</sup>John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. <sup>5</sup>People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. <sup>6</sup>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? <sup>8</sup>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. <sup>9</sup>And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. <sup>10</sup>The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>“I baptize you with<a id="filepos9118607" href="078.html#filepos9407163"><sup>[13]</sup></a> water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with<a id="filepos9118832" href="078.html#filepos9407400"><sup>[14]</sup></a> the Holy Spirit and fire. <sup>12</sup>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Baptism of Jesus</h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. <sup>14</sup>But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Jesus replied, <i>“Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.”</i> Then John consented.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. <sup>17</sup>And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”</p>

		<h4>Jesus Is Tested in the Wilderness</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted<a id="filepos9120725" href="078.html#filepos9407754"><sup>[15]</sup></a> by the devil. <sup>2</sup>After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. <sup>3</sup>The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Jesus answered, <i>“It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’</i><a id="filepos9121306" href="078.html#filepos9408035"><sup>[16]</sup></a><i>”</i></p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. <sup>6</sup>“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’<a id="filepos9122306" href="078.html#filepos9408321"><sup>[17]</sup></a>”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Jesus answered him, <i>“It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’</i><a id="filepos9122678" href="078.html#filepos9408666"><sup>[18]</sup></a><i>”</i></p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. <sup>9</sup>“All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Jesus said to him, <i>“Away from me, Satan!</i><i> For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’</i><a id="filepos9123466" href="078.html#filepos9408953"><sup>[19]</sup></a><i>”</i></p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>

		<h4>Jesus Begins to Preach</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. <sup>13</sup>Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—<sup>14</sup>to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>15</sup>“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,</p>
			<p>Galilee of the Gentiles—</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.”<a id="filepos9125470" href="078.html#filepos9409241"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>17</sup>From that time on Jesus began to preach, <i>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven</i><i> has come near.”</i></p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Jesus Calls His First Disciples</h4>
		<p><sup>18</sup>As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup>19</sup><i>“Come, follow me,”</i> Jesus said, <i>“and I will send you out to fish for people.”</i> <sup>20</sup>At once they left their nets and followed him.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, <sup>22</sup>and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Jesus Heals the Sick</h4>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. <sup>24</sup>News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them. <sup>25</sup>Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis,<a id="filepos9127653" href="078.html#filepos9409585"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.</p>

		<h4>Introduction to the Sermon on the Mount</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup>2</sup>and he began to teach them.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Beatitudes</h4>
		<p>He said:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>3</sup>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup><i>“Blessed are you when people insult you,</i><i> persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.</i> <sup>12</sup><i>Rejoice and be glad,</i> because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Salt and Light</h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup>“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup><i>“You are the light of the world.</i><i> A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.</i> <sup>15</sup><i>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</i> <sup>16</sup><i>In the same way, let your light shine before others,</i><i> that they may see your good deeds</i><i> and glorify</i> your Father in heaven.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Fulfillment of the Law</h4>
		<p><sup>17</sup><i>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</i> <sup>18</sup><i>For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</i> <sup>19</sup><i>Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands</i><i> and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</i> <sup>20</sup>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Murder</h4>
		<p><sup>21</sup><i>“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder,</i><a id="filepos9136119" href="078.html#filepos9409950"><sup>[22]</sup></a><i> and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’</i> <sup>22</sup><i>But I tell you that anyone who is angry</i><i> with a brother or sister</i><a id="filepos9136502" href="078.html#filepos9410240"><sup>[23]</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="filepos9136640" href="078.html#filepos9410653"><sup>[24]</sup></a><i> will be subject to judgment.</i><i> Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’</i><a id="filepos9136902" href="078.html#filepos9410933"><sup>[25]</sup></a><i> is answerable to the court.</i> And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.</p>
		<p><sup id="filepos9137305">23</sup><i>“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,</i> <sup>24</sup>leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup><i>“Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.</i> <sup>26</sup>Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.</p>

		<h4>Adultery</h4>
		<p><sup>27</sup><i>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’</i><a id="filepos9138720" href="078.html#filepos9411185"><sup>[26]</sup></a> <sup>28</sup><i>But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</i> <sup>29</sup><i>If your right eye causes you to stumble,</i><i> gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</i> <sup>30</sup><i>And if your right hand causes you to stumble,</i> cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>Divorce</h4>
		<p><sup>31</sup><i>“It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’</i><a id="filepos9140033" href="078.html#filepos9411475"><sup>[27]</sup></a> <sup>32</sup>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p>

		<h4>Oaths</h4>
		<p><sup>33</sup><i>“Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath,</i><i> but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’</i> <sup>34</sup><i>But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all:</i><i> either by heaven, for it is God’s throne;</i> <sup>35</sup><i>or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</i> <sup>36</sup><i>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.</i> <sup>37</sup><i>All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’;</i><i> anything beyond this comes from the evil one.</i><a id="filepos9141722" href="078.html#filepos9411763"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.</i> <sup>40</sup><i>And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.</i> <sup>41</sup><i>If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.</i> <sup>42</sup>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>Love for Enemies</h4>
		<p><sup>43</sup><i>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor</i><a id="filepos9143402" href="078.html#filepos9412428"><sup>[30]</sup></a><i> and hate your enemy.’</i> <sup>44</sup><i>But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</i> <sup>45</sup><i>that you may be children</i><i> of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</i> <sup>46</sup><i>If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?</i><i> Are not even the tax collectors doing that?</i> <sup>47</sup><i>And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?</i> <sup>48</sup>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>

		<h4>Woe on Unrepentant Towns</h4>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. <sup>21</sup><i>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!</i><i> For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon,</i><i> they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</i> <sup>22</sup><i>But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</i> <sup>23</sup><i>And you, Capernaum,</i><i> will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.</i><a id="filepos9201104" href="078.html#filepos9417989"><sup>[47]</sup></a><i> For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</i> <sup>24</sup><i>But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”</i></p>

		<h4>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. <sup>2</sup>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>He answered, <i>“Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</i> <sup>4</sup><i>He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</i> <sup>5</sup><i>Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath</i><i> and yet are innocent?</i> <sup>6</sup><i>I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.</i> <sup>7</sup><i>If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’</i><a id="filepos9205153" href="078.html#filepos9418363"><sup>[48]</sup></a><i> you would not have condemned the innocent.</i> <sup>8</sup><i>For the Son of Man</i><i> is Lord of the Sabbath.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, <sup>10</sup>and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>He said to them, <i>“If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</i> <sup>12</sup><i>How much more valuable is a person than a sheep!</i><i> Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then he said to the man, <i>“Stretch out your hand.”</i> So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. <sup>14</sup>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>God’s Chosen Servant</h4>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. <sup>16</sup>He warned them not to tell others about him. <sup>17</sup>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>18</sup>“Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight;</p>
			<p>I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>In his name the nations will put their hope.”<a id="filepos9209001" href="078.html#filepos9418650"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

		<h4>Jesus and Beelzebul</h4>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. <sup>23</sup>All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, <i>“Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</i> <sup>26</sup><i>If Satan</i><i> drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</i> <sup>27</sup><i>And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul,</i><i> by whom do your people</i><i> drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</i> <sup>28</sup><i>But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God</i><i> has come upon you.</i></p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>“Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup><i>“Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</i> <sup>31</sup><i>And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</i> <sup>32</sup><i>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age</i> or in the age to come.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup><i>“Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.</i> <sup>34</sup><i>You brood of vipers,</i><i> how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks</i><i> what the heart is full of.</i> <sup>35</sup><i>A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</i> <sup>36</sup><i>But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.</i> <sup>37</sup>For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”</p>

		<h4>The Sign of Jonah</h4>
		<p><sup>38</sup>Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>He answered, <i>“A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</i> <sup>40</sup><i>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish,</i><i> so the Son of Man</i><i> will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</i> <sup>41</sup><i>The men of Nineveh</i><i> will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah,</i><i> and now something greater than Jonah is here.</i> <sup>42</sup><i>The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came</i><i> from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.</i></p>
		<p><sup>43</sup><i>“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.</i> <sup>44</sup><i>Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.</i> <sup>45</sup><i>Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.</i> That is how it will be with this wicked generation.”</p>

		<p><sup>46</sup>While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. <sup>47</sup>Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”</p>
		<p><sup>48</sup>He replied to him, <i>“Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</i> <sup>49</sup>Pointing to his disciples, he said, <i>“Here are my mother and my brothers.</i> <sup>50</sup><i>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven</i><i> is my brother and sister and mother.”</i></p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Sower</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup>2</sup>Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup>3</sup>Then he told them many things in parables, saying: <i>“A farmer went out to sow his seed.</i> <sup>4</sup><i>As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</i> <sup>5</sup><i>Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</i> <sup>6</sup><i>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</i> <sup>7</sup><i>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</i> <sup>8</sup><i>Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred,</i><i> sixty or thirty times what was sown.</i> <sup>9</sup><i>Whoever has ears, let them hear.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>He replied, <i>“Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven</i><i> has been given to you,</i><i> but not to them.</i> <sup>12</sup><i>Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</i> <sup>13</sup><i>This is why I speak to them in parables:</i></p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>14</sup><i>In them is fulfilled</i> the prophecy of Isaiah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.</p>
			<p>Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts</p>
			<p><i>and turn, and I would heal them.’</i><a id="filepos9222383" href="078.html#filepos9419066"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>16</sup><i>But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</i> <sup>17</sup><i>For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see</i> but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup><i>“Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</i> <sup>19</sup><i>When anyone hears the message about the kingdom</i><i> and does not understand it, the evil one</i><i> comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</i> <sup>20</sup><i>The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</i> <sup>21</sup><i>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</i> <sup>22</sup><i>The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth</i><i> choke the word, making it unfruitful.</i> <sup>23</sup>But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”</p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Weeds</h4>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Jesus told them another parable: <i>“The kingdom of heaven is like</i><i> a man who sowed good seed in his field.</i> <sup>25</sup><i>But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</i> <sup>26</sup><i>When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</i></p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>“ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.</p>
		<p>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup><i>“ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.</i> <sup>30</sup>Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’ ”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</h4>
		<p><sup>31</sup>He told them another parable: <i>“The kingdom of heaven is like</i><i> a mustard seed,</i><i> which a man took and planted in his field.</i> <sup>32</sup><i>Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>He told them still another parable: <i>“The kingdom of heaven is like</i><i> yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds</i><a id="filepos9227980" href="078.html#filepos9419429"><sup>[51]</sup></a><i> of flour</i><i> until it worked all through the dough.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup>35</sup>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“I will open my mouth in parables,</p>
			<p>I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”<a id="filepos9228864" href="078.html#filepos9419676"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Weeds Explained</h4>
		<p><sup>36</sup>Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>He answered, <i>“The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</i> <sup>38</sup><i>The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,</i> <sup>39</sup><i>and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest</i><i> is the end of the age,</i><i> and the harvesters are angels.</i></p>
		<p><sup>40</sup><i>“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</i> <sup>41</sup><i>The Son of Man</i><i> will send out his angels,</i><i> and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</i> <sup>42</sup><i>They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</i> <sup>43</sup><i>Then the righteous will shine like the sun</i> in the kingdom of their Father.

		<p><sup>45</sup><i>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like</i><i> a merchant looking for fine pearls.</i> <sup>46</sup>When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Net</h4>
		<p><sup>47</sup><i>“Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like</i><i> a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds</i><i> of fish.</i> <sup>48</sup><i>When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</i> <sup>49</sup><i>This is how it will be at the end of the age.

		<p><sup>51</sup><i>“Have you understood all these things?”</i> Jesus asked.</p>
		<p>“Yes,” they replied.</p>

		<h4>A Prophet Without Honor</h4>
		<p><sup>53</sup>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup>54</sup>Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. <sup>55</sup>“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup>56</sup>Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” <sup>57</sup>And they took offense at him.</p>
		<p>But Jesus said to them, <i>“A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>58</sup>And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.</p>

		<p><sup>3</sup>Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, <sup>4</sup>for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” <sup>5</sup>Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much <sup>7</sup>that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. <sup>8</sup>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” <sup>9</sup>The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted <sup>10</sup>and had John beheaded in the prison. <sup>11</sup>His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. <sup>12</sup>John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it.

		<h4>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup>When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. <sup>14</sup>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Jesus replied, <i>“They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup><i>“Bring them here to me,”</i> he said. <sup>19</sup>And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. <sup>20</sup>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. <sup>21</sup>The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>

		<h4>Jesus Walks on the Water</h4>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup>23</sup>After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, <sup>24</sup>and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. <sup>26</sup>When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>But Jesus immediately said to them: <i>“Take courage!</i><i> It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup><i>“Come,”</i> he said.</p>
		<p>Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. <sup>30</sup>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. <i>“You of little faith,”</i> he said, <i>“why did you doubt?”</i></p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. <sup>33</sup>Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. <sup>35</sup>And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him <sup>36</sup>and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.</p>

		<h4>That Which Defiles</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, <sup>2</sup>“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Jesus replied, <i>“And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</i> <sup>4</sup><i>For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’</i><a id="filepos9243192" href="078.html#filepos9420083"><sup>[53]</sup></a><i> and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’</i><a id="filepos9243400" href="078.html#filepos9420438"><sup>[54]</sup></a> <sup>5</sup><i>But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’</i> <sup>6</sup><i>they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it.

		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <i>“Listen and understand.</i> <sup>11</sup><i>What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them,</i><i> but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He replied, <i>“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted</i><i> will be pulled up by the roots.</i> <sup>14</sup><i>Leave them; they are blind guides.</i><a id="filepos9246389" href="078.html#filepos9421082"><sup>[56]</sup></a><i> If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</i></p>

		<p><sup>25</sup>The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.</p>

		<h4>The Demand for a Sign</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>He replied, <i>“When evening comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,’</i> <sup>3</sup><i>and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</i><a id="filepos9253298" href="078.html#filepos9421475"><sup>[57]</sup></a> <sup>4</sup><i>A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</i> Jesus then left them and went away.</p>

		<p><sup>7</sup>They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, <i>“You of little faith,</i><i> why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?</i> <sup>9</sup><i>Do you still not understand?

		<p><sup>14</sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup><i>“But what about you?”</i> he asked. “Who do you say I am?”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”</p>

		<p><sup>24</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <i>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</i> <sup>25</sup><i>For whoever wants to save their life</i><a id="filepos9259711" href="078.html#filepos9422817"><sup>[62]</sup></a><i> will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.</i> <sup id="filepos9259928">26</sup><i>What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

		<p><sup>1</sup>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. <sup>2</sup>There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. <sup>3</sup>Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</p>
		<p id="filepos9261856"><sup>5</sup>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</p>

		<p><sup>9</sup>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, <i>“Don’t tell anyone</i><i> what you have seen, until the Son of Man</i><i> has been raised from the dead.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The disciples asked him, “Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Jesus replied, <i>“To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.</i> <sup>12</sup><i>But I tell you, Elijah has already come,</i><i> and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished.</i><i> In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer</i><i> at their hands.”</i> <sup>13</sup>Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.</p>

		<p><sup>19</sup>Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>He replied, <i>“Because you have so little faith.

		<h4>Divorce</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. <sup>2</sup>Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup><i>“Haven’t you read,”</i> he replied, <i>“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’</i><a id="filepos9280867" href="078.html#filepos9426679"><sup>[73]</sup></a> <sup>5</sup><i>and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’</i><a id="filepos9281185" href="078.html#filepos9426966"><sup>[74]</sup></a><i>?</i> <sup>6</sup>So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

		<p><sup>11</sup>Jesus replied, <i>“Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</i> <sup>12</sup><i>For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

		<p><sup>25</sup>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, <i>“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>Jesus said to them, <i>“Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne,</i><i> you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</i> <sup>29</sup><i>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife</i><a id="filepos9288211" href="078.html#filepos9427916"><sup>[77]</sup></a><i> or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</i> <sup>30</sup><i>But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</i></p>

		<p><sup>24</sup>When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. <sup>25</sup>Jesus called them together and said, <i>“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</i> <sup>26</sup><i>Not so with you.

		<p><sup>1</sup>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, <sup>2</sup>saying to them, <i>“Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.</i> <sup>3</sup><i>If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</i></p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>5</sup>“Say to Daughter Zion,</p>
			<p>‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”<a id="filepos9300608" href="078.html#filepos9428700"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. <sup>7</sup>They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. <sup>8</sup>A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. <sup>9</sup>The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Hosanna<a id="filepos9301356" href="078.html#filepos9428987"><sup>[80]</sup></a> to the Son of David!”</p>
			<p>“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a id="filepos9301665" href="078.html#filepos9429368"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>
			<p>“Hosanna<a id="filepos9301897" href="078.html#filepos9429715"><sup>[82]</sup></a> in the highest heaven!”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>10</sup>When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”</p>

		<h4>Jesus at the Temple</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. <sup>13</sup><i>“It is written,”</i> he said to them, <i>“ ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’</i><a id="filepos9303098" href="078.html#filepos9430096"><sup>[83]</sup></a><i> but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’</i><a id="filepos9303278" href="078.html#filepos9430386"><sup>[84]</sup></a><i>”</i></p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. <sup id="filepos9303593">15</sup>But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him.</p>
		<p>“Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘From the lips of children and infants</p>
			<p>you, Lord, have called forth your praise’<a id="filepos9304675" href="078.html#filepos9430674"><sup>[85]</sup></a>?”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>17</sup>And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.</p>

		<h4>Jesus Curses a Fig Tree</h4>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. <sup>19</sup>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, <i>“May you never bear fruit again!”</i> Immediately the tree withered.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. <sup>22</sup>If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</p>

		<h4>The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h4>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?”</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. <sup>25</sup>John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</p>
		<p>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ <sup>26</sup>But if we say, ‘Of human origin’—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.”</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”</p>
		<p>Then he said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Two Sons</h4>
		<p><sup>28</sup>“What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>“ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>“Which of the two did what his father wanted?”</p>
		<p>“The first,” they answered.</p>
		<p>Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. <sup>32</sup>For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</p>

		<h4>The Parable of the Tenants</h4>
		<p><sup>33</sup>“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. <sup>34</sup>When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>“The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. <sup>36</sup>Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. <sup>37</sup>Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.</p>
		<p><sup>38</sup>“But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’ <sup>39</sup>So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘The stone the builders rejected</p>
			<p>has become the cornerstone;</p>
		<p>the Lord has done this,</p>
		<p>and it is marvelous in our eyes’<a id="filepos9314288" href="#filepos9430979"><sup>[86]</sup></a>?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>43</sup>“Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. <sup id="filepos9314829">44</sup>Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”<a id="filepos9315000" href="#filepos9431327"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. <sup>46</sup>They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.</p>
