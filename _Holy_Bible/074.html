<p><span><span>A Call to Build the House of the <span>LORD</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua<a id="filepos8979628" href="#filepos8990044"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a> son of Jozadak,<a id="filepos8979729" href="#filepos8990323"><span><sup>[2]</sup></span></a> the high priest:</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the <span>LORD</span>’s house.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>Then the word of the <span>LORD</span> came through the prophet Haggai: <sup>4</sup>“Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>Now this is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. <sup>6</sup>You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. <sup>8</sup>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>9</sup>“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. “Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. <sup>10</sup>Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. <sup>11</sup>I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.”</span></p>
<br/><br/><p id="filepos8982017"><span><sup>12</sup>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the <span>LORD</span> their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the <span>LORD</span> their God had sent him. And the people feared the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>13</sup>Then Haggai, the <span>LORD</span>’s messenger, gave this message of the <span>LORD</span> to the people: “I am with you,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup id="filepos8982815">14</sup>So the <span>LORD</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, their God, <sup>15</sup>on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came through the prophet Haggai: <sup>2</sup>“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak,<a id="filepos8984038" href="#filepos8990846"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a> the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, <sup>3</sup>‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? <sup id="filepos8984330">4</sup>But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>5</sup>‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.’</span></p>
<p id="filepos8984871"><span><sup>6</sup>“This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. <sup>7</sup>I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>8</sup>‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>9</sup>‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Blessings for a Defiled People</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to the prophet Haggai: <sup>11</sup>“This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says: <sup>12</sup>If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span>The priests answered, “No.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>13</sup>Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>“ ‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on<a id="filepos8987541" href="#filepos8991191"><span><sup>[4]</sup></span></a>—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the <span>LORD</span>’s temple. <sup>16</sup>When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. <sup>17</sup>I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>18</sup>‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the <span>LORD</span>’s temple was laid. Give careful thought: <sup>19</sup>Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.</span></p>
<p><span>“ ‘From this day on I will bless you.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Zerubbabel the <span>LORD</span>’s Signet Ring</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>The word of the <span>LORD</span> came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: <sup>21</sup>“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. <sup>22</sup>I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>“ ‘On that day,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, ‘I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>, ‘and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.”</span></p>
