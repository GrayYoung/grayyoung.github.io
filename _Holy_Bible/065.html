<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash<a id="filepos8428032" href="#filepos8557562"><sup>[1]</sup></a> king of Israel:</p>
<p><span>Hosea’s Wife and Children</span></p>
<p><sup>2</sup>When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, “Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD.” <sup>3</sup>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. <sup>5</sup>In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”</p>
<p id="filepos8429245"><sup>6</sup>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. <sup>7</sup>Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the LORD their God, will save them.”</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. <sup id="filepos8429958">9</sup>Then the LORD said, “Call him Lo-Ammi (which means “not my people”), for you are not my people, and I am not your God.<a id="filepos8430142" href="#filepos8557833"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p id="filepos8430263"><sup>10</sup>“Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ <sup id="filepos8430580">11</sup>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.<a id="filepos8430758" href="#filepos8558111"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p id="filepos8446941"><sup>1</sup>The LORD said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. <sup>5</sup>Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king.
