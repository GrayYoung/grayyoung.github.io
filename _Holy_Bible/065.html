	<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash<a id="filepos8428032" href="#filepos8557562"><sup>[1]</sup></a> king of Israel:</p>

		<h4>Hosea’s Wife and Children</h4>
		<p><sup>2</sup>When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, “Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD.” <sup>3</sup>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. <sup>5</sup>In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”</p>
		<p id="filepos8429245"><sup>6</sup>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. <sup>7</sup>Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the LORD their God, will save them.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. <sup id="filepos8429958">9</sup>Then the LORD said, “Call him Lo-Ammi (which means “not my people”), for you are not my people, and I am not your God.<a id="filepos8430142" href="#filepos8557833"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
		<p id="filepos8430263"><sup>10</sup>“Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ <sup id="filepos8430580">11</sup>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.<a id="filepos8430758" href="#filepos8558111"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

			<p><sup>13</sup>I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>“Therefore I am now going to allure her;</p>
			<p>I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor<a id="filepos8440551" href="#filepos8558919"><sup>[5]</sup></a> a door of hope.</p>

		<h4>Hosea’s Reconciliation With His Wife</h4>
		<p id="filepos8446941"><sup>1</sup>The LORD said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>So I bought her for fifteen shekels<a id="filepos8447471" href="#filepos8561372"><sup>[14]</sup></a> of silver and about a homer and a lethek<a id="filepos8447598" href="#filepos8561638"><sup>[15]</sup></a> of barley. <sup>3</sup>Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. <sup>5</sup>Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days.</p>

		<h4>The Charge Against Israel</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land:</p>
			<p>“There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>There is only cursing,<a id="filepos8449785" href="#filepos8562055"><sup>[16]</sup></a> lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Because of this the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“But let no one bring a charge, let no one accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you.</p>
			<p>So I will destroy your mother—</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.</p>
			<p>“Because you have rejected knowledge,</p>
			<p>I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God,</p>
			<p>I also will ignore your children.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The more priests there were, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their glorious God<a id="filepos8453543" href="#filepos8562311"><sup>[17]</sup></a> for something disgraceful.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>And it will be: Like people, like priests.</p>
			<p>I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>“They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves <sup>11</sup>to prostitution; old wine and new wine take away their understanding.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner’s rod speaks to them.</p>
			<p>A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant.</p>
			<p>Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>“I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes— a people without understanding will come to ruin!</p>
			<p id="filepos8458475"><sup>15</sup>“Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty.</p>
			<p>“Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven.<a id="filepos8459089" href="#filepos8562645"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
			<p>And do not swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer.</p>
			<p>How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself.</p>
		<p>As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt.</p>
		<p>The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Then they will say, “We have no king because we did not revere the LORD.</p>
		<p>But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.</p>

		<p><sup>6</sup>It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king.</p>
		<p>Ephraim will be disgraced;</p>
		<p>Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances.</p>

		<p id="filepos8516575"><sup>8</sup>The high places of wickedness<a id="filepos8516704" href="#filepos8565960"><sup>[27]</sup></a> will be destroyed— it is the sin of Israel.</p>
		<p>Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars.</p>
		<p>Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>“Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained.<a id="filepos8517999" href="#filepos8566327"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>
		<p>Will not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck.</p>
		<p>I will drive Ephraim,</p>
		<p>Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception.</p>
		<p>Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors,</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated— as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great.</p>
		<p>When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.</p>

			<p><sup>4</sup>I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love.</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>When Ephraim spoke, people trembled; he was exalted in Israel.</p>
			<p>But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen.</p>
			<p>It is said of these people,</p>
			<p>“They offer human sacrifices!</p>
			<p>They kiss<a id="filepos8542075" href="#filepos8568438"><sup>[34]</sup></a> calf-idols!”</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“But I have been the LORD your God ever since you came out of Egypt.</p>
			<p>You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of burning heat.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>So I will be like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lurk by the path.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Like a bear robbed of her cubs,</p>
			<p>I will attack them and rip them open; like a lion I will devour them— a wild animal will tear them apart.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your helper.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Where is your king, that he may save you?</p>
			<p>Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said,</p>
			<p>‘Give me a king and princes’?</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he doesn’t have the sense to come out of the womb.</p>
			<p id="filepos8547897"><sup>14</sup>“I will deliver this people from the power of the grave;</p>
			<p>I will redeem them from death.</p>
			<p>Where, O death, are your plagues?</p>
			<p>Where, O grave, is your destruction?</p>
			<p>“I will have no compassion,</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>even though he thrives among his brothers.</p>
			<p>An east wind from the LORD will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up.</p>
			<p>His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures.</p>
			<p id="filepos8549892"><sup>16</sup>The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God.</p>
			<p>They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.”<a id="filepos8550705" href="#filepos8568704"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
