	<p>For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos4775117"><sup>1</sup>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.</p>
		<p id="filepos4776437"><sup>4</sup>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, you who are God my Savior, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>My sacrifice, O God, is<a id="filepos4781641" href="045.html#filepos5570820"><sup>[127]</sup></a> a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart</p>
		<p>you, God, will not despise.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, in burnt offerings offered whole; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</p>

		<p><sup>4</sup>My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.</p>

		<p><sup>17</sup>Evening, morning and noon</p>
		<p>I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</p>
		<p id="filepos4804162"><sup>19</sup>God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change—he will hear them and humble them, because they have no fear of God.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay; the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days.</p>

		<p><sup>4</sup>May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>May he endure<a id="filepos4927354" href="045.html#filepos5591456"><sup>[188]</sup></a> as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>May he rule from sea to sea and from the River<a id="filepos4928675" href="045.html#filepos5591726"><sup>[189]</sup></a> to the ends of the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>May the desert tribes bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him.</p>
		<p>May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Long may he live!</p>
		<p>May gold from Sheba be given him.</p>
		<p>May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway.</p>
		<p>May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive<a id="filepos4932488" href="045.html#filepos5591974"><sup>[190]</sup></a> like the grass of the field.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun.</p>

		<p><sup>18</sup>Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory.</p>

	<p>A psalm of Asaph.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped;</p>
		<p>I had nearly lost my foothold.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.<a id="filepos4936424" href="045.html#filepos5592746"><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>From their callous hearts comes iniquity<a id="filepos4937401" href="045.html#filepos5593092"><sup>[193]</sup></a>; their evil imaginations have no limits.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.<a id="filepos4938709" href="045.html#filepos5593387"><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>They say, “How would God know?</p>
		<p>Does the Most High know anything?”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>This is what the wicked are like—always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>If I had spoken out like that,</p>
		<p>I would have betrayed your children.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>I was senseless and ignorant;</p>
		<p>I was a brute beast before you.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Whom have I in heaven but you?</p>
		<p>And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>But as for me, it is good to be near God.</p>
		<p>I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge;</p>
		<p>I will tell of all your deeds.</p>

	<p>A <i>maskil</i><a id="filepos4945917" href="045.html#filepos5593784"><sup>[195]</sup></a> of Asaph.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>O God, why have you rejected us forever?</p>
		<p>Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Remember the nation you purchased long ago, the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed—Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!”</p>
		<p>They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>We are given no signs from God; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>How long will the enemy mock you, God?</p>
		<p>Will the foe revile your name forever?</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?</p>
		<p>Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>But God is my King from long ago; he brings salvation on the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Have regard for your covenant,</p>
		<p>because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace;</p>
		<p>may the poor and needy praise your name.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Rise up, O God, and defend your cause;</p>
		<p>remember how fools mock you all day long.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries,</p>
		<p>the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.</p>
