	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land, from Sela, across the desert, to the mount of Daughter Zion.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Like fluttering birds pushed from the nest, so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>“Make up your mind,” Moab says.</p>
		<p>“Render a decision.</p>
		<p>Make your shadow like night—at high noon.</p>
		<p>Hide the fugitives, do not betray the refugees.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you; be their shelter from the destroyer.”</p>
		<p>The oppressor will come to an end, and destruction will cease; the aggressor will vanish from the land.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>In love a throne will be established; in faithfulness a man will sit on it—one from the house<a id="filepos6389223" href="055.html#filepos7048801"><sup>[40]</sup></a> of David—one who in judging seeks justice and speeds the cause of righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>We have heard of Moab’s pride—how great is her arrogance!—of her conceit, her pride and her insolence; but her boasts are empty.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Therefore the Moabites wail, they wail together for Moab.</p>
		<p>Lament and grieve for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah also.</p>
		<p>The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert.</p>
		<p>Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.<a id="filepos6392230" href="055.html#filepos7049044"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah.</p>
		<p>Heshbon and Elealeh,</p>
		<p>I drench you with tears!</p>
		<p>The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>My heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>When Moab appears at her high place, she only wears herself out; when she goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no avail.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><sup>13</sup>This is the word the LORD has already spoken concerning Moab. <sup>14</sup>But now the LORD says: “Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab’s splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble.”</p>

		<h4>A Prophecy Against Damascus</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>A prophecy against Damascus:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“See, Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks, which will lie down, with no one to make them afraid.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, and royal power from Damascus; the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the Israelites,” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“In that day the glory of Jacob will fade; the fat of his body will waste away.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>It will be as when reapers harvest the standing grain, gathering the grain in their arms—as when someone gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Yet some gleanings will remain, as when an olive tree is beaten, leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches, four or five on the fruitful boughs,” declares the LORD, the God of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>In that day people will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles<a id="filepos6400499" href="055.html#filepos7049407"><sup>[42]</sup></a> and the incense altars their fingers have made.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>9</sup>In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>10</sup>You have forgotten God your Savior; you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress.</p>
			<p>Therefore, though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines,</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>though on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud, yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Woe to the many nations that rage—they rage like the raging sea!</p>
			<p>Woe to the peoples who roar—they roar like the roaring of great waters!</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters, when he rebukes them they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweed before a gale.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>In the evening, sudden terror!</p>
			<p>Before the morning, they are gone!</p>
			<p>This is the portion of those who loot us, the lot of those who plunder us.</p>

		<h4>A Prophecy Against Egypt</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>A prophecy against Egypt:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt.</p>
			<p>The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>“I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian—brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them,” declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up.</p>
			<p>The reeds and rushes will wither,</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river.</p>
			<p>Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice.</p>
			<p>How can you say to Pharaoh,</p>
			<p>“I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings”?</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Where are your wise men now?</p>
			<p>Let them show you and make known what the LORD Almighty has planned against Egypt.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>There is nothing Egypt can do—head or tail, palm branch or reed.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>16</sup>In that day the Egyptians will become weaklings. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them. <sup>17</sup>And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.<a id="filepos6421133" href="055.html#filepos7050412"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border. <sup>20</sup>It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. <sup>21</sup>So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them. <sup>22</sup>The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. <sup>24</sup>In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing<a id="filepos6422736" href="055.html#filepos7050784"><sup>[46]</sup></a> on the earth. <sup>25</sup>The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.”</p>

		<h4>A Prophecy Against Egypt and Cush</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it—<sup>2</sup>at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.” And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Then the LORD said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush,<a id="filepos6424131" href="055.html#filepos7051311"><sup>[47]</sup></a> <sup>4</sup>so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared—to Egypt’s shame. <sup id="filepos6424397">5</sup>Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame. <sup>6</sup>In that day the people who live on this coast will say, ‘See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’ ”</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>What troubles you now, that you have all gone up on the roofs,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>you town so full of commotion, you city of tumult and revelry?</p>
			<p>Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow.</p>
			<p>All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Therefore I said, “Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly.</p>
			<p>Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people.”</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses;</p>
			<p>Kir uncovers the shield.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The Lord stripped away the defenses of Judah, and you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>You saw that the walls of the City of David were broken through in many places; you stored up water in the Lower Pool.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.</p>

		<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: “Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for,” says the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">

			<p><sup>2</sup>Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.</p>

			<p><sup>4</sup>Be ashamed, Sidon, and you fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken:</p>
			<p>“I have neither been in labor nor given birth;</p>
			<p>I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.”</p>

			<p><sup>8</sup>Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring down her pride in all her splendor and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Till<a id="filepos6454537" href="055.html#filepos7053224"><sup>[52]</sup></a> your land as they do along the Nile,</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>15</sup>At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king’s life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:</p>

		<p><sup>17</sup>At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. <sup>18</sup>Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.</p>

		<h4>The LORD’s Devastation of the Earth</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>See, the LORD is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants—</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>it will be the same for priest as for people, for the master as for his servant, for the mistress as for her servant, for seller as for buyer, for borrower as for lender, for debtor as for creditor.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered.</p>
			<p>The LORD has spoken this word.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the heavens languish with the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt.</p>
			<p>Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The joyful timbrels are stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all joyful sounds are banished from the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the LORD’s majesty.</p>

			<p>With treachery the treacherous betray!”</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Terror and pit and snare await you, people of the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare.</p>
			<p>The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is violently shaken.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls—never to rise again.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished<a id="filepos6472837" href="055.html#filepos7053894"><sup>[54]</sup></a> after many days.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>We have a strong city;</p>
			<p>God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD himself, is the Rock eternal.</p>

			<p><sup>6</sup>Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The path of the righteous is level;</p>
			<p>you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Yes, LORD, walking in the way of your laws,<a id="filepos6486938" href="055.html#filepos7054651"><sup>[56]</sup></a> we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.</p>

			<p>When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>But when grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>LORD, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it.</p>
			<p>Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>They are now dead, they live no more; their spirits do not rise.</p>
			<p>You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>You have enlarged the nation, LORD; you have enlarged the nation.</p>
			<p>You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>LORD, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer.<a id="filepos6492362" href="055.html#filepos7054895"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>We were with child, we writhed in labor, but we gave birth to wind.</p>
			<p>We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the people of the world have not come to life.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>But your dead will live, LORD; their bodies will rise—let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy—your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.</p>
			<p id="filepos6494769"><sup>20</sup>Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.</p>

		<h4>Woe to the Leaders of Ephraim and Judah</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley—to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong.</p>
			<p>Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>That wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before harvest—as soon as people see them and take them in hand, they swallow them.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer:</p>
			<p>Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“Who is it he is trying to teach?</p>
			<p>To whom is he explaining his message?</p>
			<p>To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>For it is:</p>
			<p>Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that<a id="filepos6511674" href="055.html#filepos7055975"><sup>[60]</sup></a>; a little here, a little there.”</p>
			<p id="filepos6511980"><sup>11</sup>Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues</p>
			<p>God will speak to this people,</p>
			<p id="filepos6512341"><sup>12</sup>to whom he said,</p>
			<p>“This is the resting place, let the weary rest”;</p>
			<p>and, “This is the place of repose”—but they would not listen.</p>
			<p id="filepos6513028"><sup>13</sup>So then, the word of the LORD to them will become:</p>
			<p>Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that; a little here, a little there—so that as they go they will fall backward; they will be injured and snared and captured.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death, with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement.</p>
			<p>When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood<a id="filepos6515430" href="055.html#filepos7056395"><sup>[61]</sup></a> our hiding place.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p id="filepos6515603"><sup>16</sup>So this is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand.</p>
			<p>When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.”</p>
			<p>The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon—to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually?</p>
			<p>Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin?</p>
			<p>Does he not plant wheat in its place,<a id="filepos6521714" href="055.html#filepos7056641"><sup>[62]</sup></a> barley in its plot,<a id="filepos6521946" href="055.html#filepos7056920"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and spelt in its field?</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever.</p>
			<p>The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it, but one does not use horses to grind grain.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, whose plan is wonderful, whose wisdom is magnificent.</p>

			<p>Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper.</p>

		<p id="filepos6531784"><sup>13</sup>The Lord says:</p>

			<p id="filepos6532844"><sup>14</sup>Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.”</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think,</p>
			<p>“Who sees us? Who will know?”</p>
			<p id="filepos6534255"><sup>16</sup>You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay!</p>

		<p><sup>23</sup>He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. <sup>24</sup>The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. <sup>25</sup>In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. <sup>26</sup>The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.</p>
