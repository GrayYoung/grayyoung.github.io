<p><span><span>The Treasurers and Other Officials</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Their fellow Levites were<a id="filepos3397511" href="#filepos3469806"><span><sup>[121]</sup></span></a> in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>The descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan and who were heads of families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli, <sup>22</sup>the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the temple of the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites:</span></p>
<br/><div>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>Shubael, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the official in charge of the treasuries. <sup>25</sup>His relatives through Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zikri his son and Shelomith his son. <sup>26</sup>Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and by the other army commanders. <sup>27</sup>Some of the plunder taken in battle they dedicated for the repair of the temple of the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>28</sup>And everything dedicated by Samuel the seer and by Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah, and all the other dedicated things were in the care of Shelomith and his relatives.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were assigned duties away from the temple, as officials and judges over Israel.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his relatives—seventeen hundred able men—were responsible in Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the <span>LORD</span> and for the king’s service. <sup>31</sup>As for the Hebronites, Jeriah was their chief according to the genealogical records of their families. In the fortieth year of David’s reign a search was made in the records, and capable men among the Hebronites were found at Jazer in Gilead. <sup>32</sup>Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred relatives, who were able men and heads of families, and King David put them in charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="dummy_split_004.html#filepos90713"><span>1 Chronicles 28</span></a></span></p><div> </div>
<div>
<p><span><span>David’s Plans for the Temple</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>David summoned all the officials of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem: the officers over the tribes, the commanders of the divisions in the service of the king, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the warriors and all the brave fighting men.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my fellow Israelites, my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the <span>LORD</span>, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it. <sup>3</sup>But God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>“Yet the <span>LORD</span>, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the tribe of Judah he chose my family, and from my father’s sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel. <sup>5</sup>Of all my sons—and the <span>LORD</span> has given me many—he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the <span>LORD</span> over Israel. <sup>6</sup>He said to me: ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. <sup>7</sup>I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>“So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the <span>LORD</span>, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>“And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the <span>LORD</span> searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever. <sup>10</sup>Consider now, for the <span>LORD</span> has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary. Be strong and do the work.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement. <sup>12</sup>He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the <span>LORD</span> and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things. <sup>13</sup>He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the <span>LORD</span>, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service. <sup>14</sup>He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service: <sup>15</sup>the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand; <sup>16</sup>the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables; <sup>17</sup>the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish; <sup>18</sup>and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and overshadow the ark of the covenant of the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>“All this,” David said, “I have in writing as a result of the <span>LORD</span>’s hand on me, and he enabled me to understand all the details of the plan.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the <span>LORD</span> God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the <span>LORD</span> is finished. <sup>21</sup>The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing person skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command.”</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Gifts for Building the Temple</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then King David said to the whole assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the <span>LORD</span> God. <sup>2</sup>With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God—gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise,<a id="filepos3417594" href="#filepos3470594"><span><sup>[123]</sup></span></a> stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble—all of these in large quantities. <sup>3</sup>Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple: <sup>4</sup>three thousand talents<a id="filepos3418023" href="#filepos3470873"><span><sup>[124]</sup></span></a> of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents<a id="filepos3418161" href="#filepos3471147"><span><sup>[125]</sup></span></a> of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings, <sup>5</sup>for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate themselves to the <span>LORD</span> today?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly. <sup>7</sup>They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents<a id="filepos3418909" href="#filepos3471421"><span><sup>[126]</sup></span></a> and ten thousand darics<a id="filepos3419020" href="#filepos3471695"><span><sup>[127]</sup></span></a> of gold, ten thousand talents<a id="filepos3419137" href="#filepos3471968"><span><sup>[128]</sup></span></a> of silver, eighteen thousand talents<a id="filepos3419261" href="#filepos3472242"><span><sup>[129]</sup></span></a> of bronze and a hundred thousand talents<a id="filepos3419389" href="#filepos3472516"><span><sup>[130]</sup></span></a> of iron. <sup>8</sup>Anyone who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the <span>LORD</span> in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite. <sup>9</sup>The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the <span>LORD</span>. David the king also rejoiced greatly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>David’s Prayer</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>David praised the <span>LORD</span> in the presence of the whole assembly, saying,</span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span>“Praise be to you, <span>LORD</span>,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the God of our father Israel,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>from everlasting to everlasting.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>11</sup>Yours, <span>LORD</span>, is the greatness and the power</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and the glory and the majesty and the splendor,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>for everything in heaven and earth is yours.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Yours, <span>LORD</span>, is the kingdom;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>you are exalted as head over all.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>12</sup>Wealth and honor come from you;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>you are the ruler of all things.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In your hands are strength and power</span></p></blockquote><p><span>to exalt and give strength to all.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>13</sup>Now, our God, we give you thanks,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and praise your glorious name.</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><sup>14</sup>“But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. <sup>15</sup>We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. <sup>16</sup><span>LORD</span> our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. <sup>17</sup>I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you. <sup>18</sup><span>LORD</span>, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you. <sup>19</sup>And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the <span>LORD</span> your God.” So they all praised the <span>LORD</span>, the God of their fathers; they bowed down, prostrating themselves before the <span>LORD</span> and the king.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Solomon Acknowledged as King</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>The next day they made sacrifices to the <span>LORD</span> and presented burnt offerings to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. <sup>22</sup>They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the <span>LORD</span> that day.</span></p>
<p><span>Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the <span>LORD</span> to be ruler and Zadok to be priest. <sup>23</sup>So Solomon sat on the throne of the <span>LORD</span> as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. <sup>24</sup>All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>The <span>LORD</span> highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Death of David</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>26</sup>David son of Jesse was king over all Israel. <sup>27</sup>He ruled over Israel forty years—seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. <sup>28</sup>He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer, <sup>30</sup>together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.</span></p>
