		<h4>Sin, Confession and Redemption</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>But your iniquities have separated</p>
			<p>you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt.</p>
			<p>Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity.</p>
			<p>They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider’s web.</p>
			<p>Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make.</p>
			<p>Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.</p>
			<p id="filepos6933892"><sup>7</sup>Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood.</p>
			<p>They pursue evil schemes; acts of violence mark their ways.</p>
			<p id="filepos6934544"><sup>8</sup>The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths.</p>
			<p>They have turned them into crooked roads;</p>
			<p>no one who walks along them will know peace.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us.</p>
			<p>We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes.</p>
			<p>At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves.</p>
			<p>We look for justice, but find none;</p>
			<p>for deliverance, but it is far away.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us.</p>
			<p>Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities:</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Truth is nowhere to be found,</p>
			<p>and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.</p>
			<p>The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>From the west, people will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory.</p>
			<p>For he will come like a pent-up flood</p>
			<p>that the breath of the LORD drives along.<a id="filepos6942918" href="#filepos7074082"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>
			<p id="filepos6943060"><sup>20</sup>“The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins,”</p>
			<p>declares the LORD.</p>

			<p><sup>3</sup>Nations will come to your light,</p>

			<p><sup>4</sup>“Lift up your eyes and look about you:</p>
			<p>All assemble and come to you; your sons come from afar, and your daughters are carried on the hip.</p>

			<p>And all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you; they will be accepted as offerings on my altar,</p>
			<p>and I will adorn my glorious temple.</p>

			<p><sup>12</sup>For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish;</p>
			<p>it will be utterly ruined.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the juniper, the fir and the cypress together, to adorn my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place for my feet.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The children of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the LORD,</p>
			<p>Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>“Although you have been forsaken and hated, with no one traveling through,</p>
			<p>I will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>You will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts.</p>
			<p>Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Instead of bronze I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron.</p>
			<p>Instead of wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones.</p>
			<p>I will make peace your governor and well-being your ruler.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land forever.</p>
			<p>They are the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation.</p>
			<p>I am the LORD;</p>

			<p>They have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations;</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring on them what they dread.</p>
			<p>For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened.</p>
			<p>They did evil in my sight</p>
			<p>and chose what displeases me.”</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word:</p>
			<p>“Your own people who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said,</p>
			<p>‘Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!’</p>
			<p>Yet they will be put to shame.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple!</p>
			<p>It is the sound of the LORD</p>
			<p>repaying his enemies all they deserve.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Who has ever heard of such things?</p>
			<p>Who has ever seen things like this?</p>
			<p>Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment?</p>
			<p>Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the LORD.</p>
			<p>“Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>“Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply</p>
			<p>and delight in her overflowing abundance.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>12</sup>For this is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you;</p>
			<p>and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.”</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment on all people,</p>
			<p>and many will be those slain by the LORD.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>17</sup>“Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things—they will meet their end together with the one they follow,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>“And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come<a id="filepos7033910" href="#filepos7078167"><sup>[124]</sup></a> and gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>“I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans<a id="filepos7034325" href="#filepos7078449"><sup>[125]</sup></a> and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. <sup>20</sup>And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels. <sup>21</sup>And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>“As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the LORD, “so will your name and descendants endure. <sup>23</sup>From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the LORD. <sup id="filepos7035671">24</sup>“And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”</p>
