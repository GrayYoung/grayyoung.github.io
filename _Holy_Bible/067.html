	<p><sup>1</sup>The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa—the vision he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash<a id="filepos8625820" href="#filepos8722940"><sup>[1]</sup></a> was king of Israel.</p>

		<h4>Witnesses Summoned Against Israel</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the LORD has spoken against you—against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins.”</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Does a lion roar in the thicket when it has no prey?</p>
			<p>Does it growl in its den when it has caught nothing?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there?</p>
			<p>Does a trap spring up from the ground if it has not caught anything?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble?</p>
			<p>When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The lion has roared—who will not fear?</p>
			<p>The Sovereign LORD has spoken—who can but prophesy?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt:</p>
			<p>“Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.”</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>“They do not know how to do right,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses.”</p>

		<p><sup>12</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>

			<p>“As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the head of a bed and a piece of fabric<a id="filepos8655135" href="#filepos8725157"><sup>[9]</sup></a> from a couch.<a id="filepos8655234" href="#filepos8725436"><sup>[10]</sup></a>”</p>

			<p><sup>14</sup>“On the day I punish Israel for her sins,</p>
			<p>I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.</p>

			<p><sup>2</sup>The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness:</p>
			<p>“The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks.<a id="filepos8658807" href="#filepos8725898"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

			<p><sup>4</sup>“Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more.</p>
			<p>Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years.<a id="filepos8660330" href="#filepos8726522"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings—boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do,” declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>“I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away.</p>
			<p>I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another.</p>
			<p>One field had rain; another had none and dried up.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew.</p>
			<p>Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>“I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt.</p>
			<p>I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses.</p>
			<p>I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>“I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
			<p>You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God.”</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth—the LORD God Almighty is his name.</p>

		<h4>A Lament and Call to Repentance</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>3</sup>This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Israel:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>4</sup>This is what the LORD says to Israel:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Seek me and live;</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Beersheba.</p>
			<p>For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.<a id="filepos8671462" href="#filepos8726874"><sup>[14]</sup></a>”</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Seek the LORD and live, or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; it will devour them, and Bethel will have no one to quench it.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>There are those who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land—the LORD is his name.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>You levy a straw tax on the poor and impose a tax on their grain.</p>
			<p>Therefore, though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them; though you have planted lush vineyards, you will not drink their wine.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins.</p>
			<p>There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times, for the times are evil.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Seek good, not evil, that you may live.</p>
			<p>Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Hate evil, love good; maintain justice in the courts.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the LORD God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Therefore this is what the Lord, the LORD God Almighty, says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square.</p>
			<p>The farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst,” says the LORD.</p>

			<p>Why do you long for the day of the LORD?</p>
			<p>That day will be darkness, not light.</p>

			<p>pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?</p>

			<p><sup>23</sup>Away with the noise of your songs!</p>
			<p>I will not listen to the music of your harps.</p>

			<p id="filepos8683237"><sup>25</sup>“Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god<a id="filepos8684056" href="#filepos8727243"><sup>[15]</sup></a>—which you made for yourselves.</p>

		<h4>Locusts, Fire and a Plumb Line</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. <sup>2</sup>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign LORD, forgive!

		<p><sup>14</sup>Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. <sup>15</sup>But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ <sup>16</sup>Now then, hear the word of the LORD.

		<h4>Israel to Be Destroyed</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake.</p>
			<p>Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword.</p>
			<p>Not one will get away, none will escape.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Though they dig down to the depths below, from there my hand will take them.</p>
			<p>Though they climb up to the heavens above, from there I will bring them down.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them.</p>
			<p>Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them.</p>
			<p>“I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good.”</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The Lord, the LORD Almighty—he touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn; the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt;</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>he builds his lofty palace<a id="filepos8713942" href="#filepos8730633"><sup>[25]</sup></a> in the heavens and sets its foundation<a id="filepos8714193" href="#filepos8730912"><sup>[26]</sup></a> on the earth; he calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land—the LORD is his name.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites<a id="filepos8715157" href="#filepos8731189"><sup>[27]</sup></a>?” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p>“Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor<a id="filepos8715765" href="#filepos8731455"><sup>[28]</sup></a> and the Arameans from Kir?</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>“Surely the eyes of the Sovereign LORD are on the sinful kingdom.</p>
			<p>I will destroy it from the face of the earth.</p>
			<p>Yet I will not totally destroy the descendants of Jacob,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“For I will give the command, and I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say,</p>
			<p>‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’</p>

		<h4>Israel’s Restoration</h4>
		<p id="filepos8718859"><sup>11</sup>“In that day</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“I will restore David’s fallen shelter—</p>
			<p>I will repair its broken walls and restore its ruins—and will rebuild it as it used to be,</p>
			<p id="filepos8719676"><sup>12</sup>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name,<a id="filepos8719986" href="#filepos8731693"><sup>[29]</sup></a>” declares the LORD, who will do these things.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>13</sup>“The days are coming,” declares the LORD,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes.</p>
			<p>New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>and I will bring my people Israel back from exile.<a id="filepos8721395" href="#filepos8732025"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
			<p>“They will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them.</p>
			<p>They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them,” says the LORD your God.</p>
