		<p><sup>15</sup>My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>How precious to me are your thoughts,<a id="filepos5460164" href="045.html#filepos5627267"><sup>[291]</sup></a> God!</p>
		<p>How vast is the sum of them!</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand—when I awake, I am still with you.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>If only you, God, would slay the wicked!</p>
		<p>Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>I have nothing but hatred for them;</p>
		<p>I count them my enemies.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
