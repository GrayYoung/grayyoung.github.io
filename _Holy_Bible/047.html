	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos142230">Proverbs 17</a></h3>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the family.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tests the heart.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>A wicked person listens to deceitful lips; a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker; whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Children’s children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool—how much worse lying lips to a ruler!</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it; they think success will come at every turn.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>A rebuke impresses a discerning person more than a hundred lashes a fool.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Evildoers foster rebellion against God; the messenger of death will be sent against them.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool bent on folly.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Evil will never leave the house of one who pays back evil for good.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—the LORD detests them both.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom, when they are not able to understand it?</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge and puts up security for a neighbor.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds a high gate invites destruction.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper; one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>To have a fool for a child brings grief; there is no joy for the parent of a godless fool.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The wicked accept bribes in secret to pervert the course of justice.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>A discerning person keeps wisdom in view, but a fool’s eyes wander to the ends of the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the mother who bore him.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>If imposing a fine on the innocent is not good, surely to flog honest officials is not right.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues.</p>

	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos142412">Proverbs 18</a></h3>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends and against all sound judgment starts quarrels.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>When wickedness comes, so does contempt, and with shame comes reproach.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The words of the mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a rushing stream.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>It is not good to be partial to the wicked and so deprive the innocent of justice.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The lips of fools bring them strife, and their mouths invite a beating.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The mouths of fools are their undoing, and their lips are a snare to their very lives.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The name of the LORD is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall too high to scale.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Before a downfall the heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>To answer before listening—that is folly and shame.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear?</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes forward and cross-examines.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Desire without knowledge is not good—how much more will hasty feet miss the way!</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>A person’s own folly leads to their ruin, yet their heart rages against the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Wealth attracts many friends, but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The poor are shunned by all their relatives—how much more do their friends avoid them!</p>
		<p>Though the poor pursue them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found.<a id="filepos5840801" href="048.html#filepos6008916"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>A person’s wisdom yields patience; it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>A foolish child is a father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like the constant dripping of a leaky roof.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life, but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Discipline your children, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to their death.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>What a person desires is unfailing love<a id="filepos5846523" href="048.html#filepos6009198"><sup>[35]</sup></a>; better to be poor than a liar.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The fear of the LORD leads to life; then one rests content, untouched by trouble.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth!</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>A king’s wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; those who anger him forfeit their lives.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>It is to one’s honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The purposes of a person’s heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find?</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure;</p>
		<p>I am clean and without sin”?</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Differing weights and differing measures—the LORD detests them both.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright?</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Ears that hear and eyes that see—the LORD has made them both.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“It’s no good, it’s no good!” says the buyer—then goes off and boasts about the purchase.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Do not say, “I’ll pay you back for this wrong!”</p>
		<p>Wait for the LORD, and he will avenge you.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>A person’s steps are directed by the LORD.</p>
		<p>How then can anyone understand their own way?</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one’s vows.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>The human spirit is<a id="filepos5859464" href="048.html#filepos6009584"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the lamp of the LORD that sheds light on one’s inmost being.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>In the LORD’s hand the king’s heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>A person may think their own ways are right, but the LORD weighs the heart.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Haughty eyes and a proud heart—the unplowed field of the wicked—produce sin.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.<a id="filepos5863365" href="048.html#filepos6009965"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The wicked crave evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The Righteous One<a id="filepos5865438" href="048.html#filepos6010300"><sup>[38]</sup></a> takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Whoever strays from the path of prudence comes to rest in the company of the dead.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity<a id="filepos5868971" href="048.html#filepos6010556"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and honor.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>The proud and arrogant person—“Mocker” is his name—behaves with insolent fury.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—how much more so when brought with evil intent!</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>A false witness will perish, but a careful listener will testify successfully.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>The wicked put up a bold front, but the upright give thought to their ways.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD.</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Rich and poor have this in common:</p>
		<p>The LORD is the Maker of them all.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Humility is the fear of the LORD; its wages are riches and honor and life.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls, but those who would preserve their life stay far from them.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.</p>

		<h4>Further Sayings of the Wise</h4>
		<p><sup>23</sup>These also are sayings of the wise:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>To show partiality in judging is not good:</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent,” will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come on them.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Put your outdoor work in order and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Do not testify against your neighbor without cause—would you use your lips to mislead?</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Do not say, “I’ll do to them as they have done to me;</p>
			<p>I’ll pay them back for what they did.”</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>I went past the field of a sluggard, past the vineyard of someone who has no sense;</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw:</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.</p>

		<h4>More Proverbs of Solomon</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Remove the dross from the silver, and a silversmith can produce a vessel;</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>remove wicked officials from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence, and do not claim a place among his great men;</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” than for him to humiliate you before his nobles.</p>
			<p>What you have seen with your eyes</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>do not bring<a id="filepos5918943" href="048.html#filepos6011608"><sup>[42]</sup></a> hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>If you take your neighbor to court, do not betray another’s confidence,</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>or the one who hears it may shame you and the charge against you will stand.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Like apples<a id="filepos5920245" href="048.html#filepos6011909"><sup>[43]</sup></a> of gold in settings of silver is a ruling rightly given.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him; he refreshes the spirit of his master.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts of gifts never given.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>If you find honey, eat just enough—too much of it, and you will vomit.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house—too much of you, and they will hate you.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on a wound, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</p>
			<p id="filepos5924193"><sup>21</sup>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.</p>
			<p id="filepos5924559"><sup>22</sup>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.</p>

		<p><sup>21</sup>As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware are fervent<a id="filepos5935482" href="048.html#filepos6012281"><sup>[44]</sup></a> lips with an evil heart.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, but in their hearts they harbor deceit.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, for seven abominations fill their hearts.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Their malice may be concealed by deception, but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.</p>

			<p><sup>5</sup>lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish!</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.</p>

		<p>Epilogue: The Wife of Noble Character</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p id="filepos5989339"><sup>10</sup><a id="filepos5989440" href="#filepos6015278"><sup>[53]</sup></a>A wife of noble character who can find?</p>
			<p>She is worth far more than rubies.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>“Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.”</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.</p>
