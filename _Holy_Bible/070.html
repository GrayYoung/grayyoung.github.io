	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos189726">Micah 1</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>2</sup>Hear, you peoples, all of you,</p>
		<p>listen, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign LORD may bear witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<section>
		<h4>Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>3</sup>Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>All this is because of Jacob’s transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel.</p>
			<p>What is Jacob’s transgression?</p>
			<p>Is it not Samaria?</p>
			<p>What is Judah’s high place?</p>
			<p>Is it not Jerusalem?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>“Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards.</p>
			<p>I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire;</p>
			<p>I will destroy all her images.</p>
			<p>Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.”</p>

		<h4>Weeping and Mourning</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>8</sup>Because of this I will weep and wail;</p>
			<p>I will go about barefoot and naked.</p>
			<p>I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>For Samaria’s plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah.</p>
			<p>It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Tell it not in Gath<a id="filepos8773648" href="#filepos8846434"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; weep not at all.</p>
			<p>In Beth Ophrah<a id="filepos8774018" href="#filepos8846709"><sup>[2]</sup></a> roll in the dust.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir.<a id="filepos8774576" href="#filepos8846979"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
			<p>Those who live in Zaanan<a id="filepos8774812" href="#filepos8847240"><sup>[4]</sup></a> will not come out.</p>
			<p>Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Those who live in Maroth<a id="filepos8775522" href="#filepos8847521"><sup>[5]</sup></a> writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot.</p>
			<p>You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath.</p>
			<p>The town of Akzib<a id="filepos8777293" href="#filepos8847800"><sup>[6]</sup></a> will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah.<a id="filepos8777884" href="#filepos8848060"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
			<p>The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Shave your head in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourself as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.</p>

		<h4>Human Plans and God’s Plans</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds!</p>
			<p>At morning’s light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them.</p>
			<p>They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Therefore, the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves.</p>
			<p>You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song:</p>
			<p>‘We are utterly ruined; my people’s possession is divided up.</p>
			<p>He takes it from me!</p>
			<p>He assigns our fields to traitors.’ ”</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.</p>

		<h4>False Prophets</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>6</sup>“Do not prophesy,” their prophets say.</p>
			<p>“Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us.”</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>You descendants of Jacob, should it be said,</p>
			<p>“Does the LORD become<a id="filepos8783978" href="#filepos8848459"><sup>[8]</sup></a> impatient?</p>
			<p>Does he do such things?”</p>
			<p>“Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright?</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Lately my people have risen up like an enemy.</p>
			<p>You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes.</p>
			<p>You take away my blessing from their children forever.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Get up, go away!</p>
			<p>For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>If a liar and deceiver comes and says,</p>
			<p>‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’ that would be just the prophet for this people!</p>

		<h4>Deliverance Promised</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>12</sup>“I will surely gather all of you, Jacob;</p>
			<p>I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel.</p>
			<p>I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.</p>

		<h4>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then I said,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel.</p>
			<p>Should you not embrace justice,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones;</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>who eat my people’s flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?”</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them.</p>
			<p>At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>5</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim ‘peace’ if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination.</p>
			<p>The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced.</p>
			<p>They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.”</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money.</p>
			<p>Yet they look for the LORD’s support and say,</p>
			<p>“Is not the LORD among us?</p>
			<p>No disaster will come upon us.”</p>
			<p id="filepos8797345"><sup>12</sup>Therefore because of you,</p>
			<p>Zion will be plowed like a field,</p>
			<p>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.</p>

			<p>I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>I will make the lame my remnant, those driven away a strong nation.</p>
			<p>The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.</p>

			<p><sup>10</sup>Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field.</p>
			<p>You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued.</p>
			<p>There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>But now many nations are gathered against you.</p>
			<p>They say, “Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!”</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will give you horns of iron;</p>
			<p>I will give you hooves of bronze, and you will break to pieces many nations.”</p>
			<p>You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.</p>
