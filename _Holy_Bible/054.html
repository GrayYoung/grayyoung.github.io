			<p>The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>“Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob, all the remnant of the people of Israel, you whom I have upheld since your birth, and have carried since you were born.</p>

			<p>I am he, I am he who will sustain you.</p>
			<p>I have made you and I will carry you;</p>
			<p>I will sustain you and I will rescue you.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>“With whom will you compare me or count me equal?</p>
			<p>To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands.</p>
			<p>From that spot it cannot move.</p>
			<p>Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer; it cannot save them from their troubles.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>“Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Remember the former things, those of long ago;</p>
			<p>I am God, and there is no other;</p>
			<p>I am God, and there is none like me.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come.</p>
			<p>I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose.</p>
			<p>What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that I will do.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are now far from my righteousness.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed.</p>
			<p>I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel.</p>

			<p>I will take vengeance;</p>
			<p>I will spare no one.”</p>

			<p>Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke.</p>
			<p id="filepos6778950"><sup>7</sup>You said, ‘I am forever—the eternal queen!’</p>

			<p>‘I am, and there is none besides me.</p>
			<p>I will never be a widow or suffer the loss of children.’</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a single day: loss of children and widowhood.</p>
			<p>They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and all your potent spells.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>You have trusted in your wickedness and have said, ‘No one sees me.’</p>
			<p>Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you when you say to yourself,</p>
			<p>‘I am, and there is none besides me.’</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to conjure it away.</p>
			<p>A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom; a catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Keep on, then, with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood.</p>
			<p>Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>All the counsel you have received has only worn you out!</p>
			<p>Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up.</p>
			<p>They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame.</p>
			<p>These are not coals for warmth; this is not a fire to sit by.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>That is all they are to you—these you have dealt with and labored with since childhood.</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">

			<p>Before I was born the LORD called me; from my mother’s womb he has spoken my name.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.</p>

			<p><sup>7</sup>This is what the LORD says—the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel—to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers:</p>
