<p><span>Ezekiel’s Inaugural Vision</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— <sup>3</sup>the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<a id="filepos7875196" href="062.html#filepos8257096"><sup>[1]</sup></a> There the hand of the LORD was on him.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, <sup>5</sup>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, <sup>6</sup>but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup>7</sup>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. <sup>8</sup>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, <sup>9</sup>and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. <sup>11</sup>Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. <sup>12</sup>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <sup>13</sup>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. <sup>14</sup>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. <sup>16</sup>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup>17</sup>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. <sup>18</sup>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <sup>20</sup>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup>21</sup>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. <sup>23</sup>Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. <sup>24</sup>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<a id="filepos7878863" href="062.html#filepos8257338"><sup>[2]</sup></a> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. <sup>26</sup>Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. <sup>27</sup>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup>28</sup>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.</p>
<p>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</p>

<h3><a href="004.html#filepos172266">Ezekiel 2</a></h3>
<div>
<p><span>Ezekiel’s Call to Be a Prophet</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>He said to me, “Son of man,<a id="filepos7880438" href="062.html#filepos8257700"><sup>[3]</sup></a> stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” <sup>2</sup>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. <sup>4</sup>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’ <sup>5</sup>And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. <sup>6</sup>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. <sup>7</sup>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. <sup>8</sup>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, <sup>10</sup>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="filepos7882181">
<h3><a href="004.html#filepos172446">Ezekiel 3</a></h3>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.” <sup>2</sup>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</p>
<p id="filepos7882664"><sup>3</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. <sup>5</sup>You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel— <sup>6</sup>not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. <sup>7</sup>But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. <sup>8</sup>But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. <sup>9</sup>I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. <sup>11</sup>Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”</p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the LORD rose from the place where it was standing.<a id="filepos7884533" href="062.html#filepos8258277"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
<sup>13</sup>It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. <sup>14</sup>The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD on me. <sup>15</sup>I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.</span></p>
<p><span>Ezekiel’s Task as Watchman</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup>At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>17</sup>“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. <sup>18</sup>When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for<a id="filepos7885841" href="062.html#filepos8258668"><sup>[5]</sup></a> their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. <sup id="filepos7885987">19</sup>But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.</p>
<p id="filepos7886203"><sup>20</sup>“Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. <sup>21</sup>But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The hand of the LORD was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” <sup>23</sup>So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup>25</sup>And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. <sup>26</sup>I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. <sup>27</sup>But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.</p>

<h4>Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>“Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. <sup>2</sup>Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. <sup>3</sup>Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>“Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself.<a id="filepos7889143" href="062.html#filepos8259153"><sup>[6]</sup></a> You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. <sup>5</sup>I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>“After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. <sup>7</sup>Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. <sup>8</sup>I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>“Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. <sup>10</sup>Weigh out twenty shekels<a id="filepos7890309" href="062.html#filepos8259400"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of food to eat each day and eat it at set times. <sup>11</sup>Also measure out a sixth of a hin<a id="filepos7890490" href="062.html#filepos8259666"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of water and drink it at set times. <sup>12</sup>Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.” <sup>13</sup>The LORD said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.”</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.”</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>“Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.”</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, <sup>17</sup>for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of<a id="filepos7891926" href="062.html#filepos8259933"><sup>[9]</sup></a> their sin.</p>

<p><span>God’s Razor of Judgment</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>“Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair. <sup>2</sup>When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. <sup>3</sup>But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. <sup>4</sup>Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her. <sup>6</sup>Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even<a id="filepos7893868" href="062.html#filepos8260291"><sup>[10]</sup></a> conformed to the standards of the nations around you.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations. <sup>9</sup>Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again. <sup>10</sup>Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds. <sup>11</sup>Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you. <sup>12</sup>A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>“Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the LORD have spoken in my zeal.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>“I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by. <sup>15</sup>You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the LORD have spoken. <sup>16</sup>When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food. <sup>17</sup>I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless.

<h4>Doom for the Mountains of Israel</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them <sup>3</sup>and say: ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. <sup>4</sup>Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols. <sup>5</sup>I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. <sup>6</sup>Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out. <sup>7</sup>Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“ ‘But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations. <sup>9</sup>Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices. <sup>10</sup>And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>“ ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and plague. <sup>12</sup>One who is far away will die of the plague, and one who is near will fall by the sword, and anyone who survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I pour out my wrath on them. <sup>13</sup>And they will know that I am the LORD, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols. <sup>14</sup>And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah<a id="filepos7899697" href="062.html#filepos8260707"><sup>[11]</sup></a>—wherever they live.

<p><sup>1</sup>In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came on me there. <sup>2</sup>I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man.<a id="filepos7920418" href="062.html#filepos8261795"><sup>[14]</sup></a> From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal. <sup>3</sup>He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. <sup>4</sup>And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall. <sup>8</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.” <sup>10</sup>So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. <sup>11</sup>In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.’ ” <sup>13</sup>Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. <sup>15</sup>He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose! <sup>18</sup>Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”</p>

<h4>Judgment on the Idolaters</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.” <sup>2</sup>And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side <sup>4</sup>and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.”</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. <sup>6</sup>Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city. <sup>8</sup>While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.’ <sup>10</sup>So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.”</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”</p>

<p><span>God’s Glory Departs From the Temple</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim. <sup>2</sup>The LORD said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. <sup>4</sup>Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the LORD. <sup>5</sup>The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty<a id="filepos7929122" href="062.html#filepos8262165"><sup>[15]</sup></a> when he speaks.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>When the LORD commanded the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. <sup>7</sup>Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out. <sup>8</sup>(Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. <sup>10</sup>As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup>11</sup>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about<a id="filepos7930269" href="062.html#filepos8262414"><sup>[16]</sup></a> as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went. <sup>12</sup>Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels. <sup>13</sup>I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.” <sup>14</sup>Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River. <sup>16</sup>When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side. <sup>17</sup>When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Then the glory of the LORD departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. <sup>19</sup>While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. <sup>21</sup>Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands. <sup>22</sup>Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.</p>

<p><span>God’s Sure Judgment on Jerusalem</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. <sup>2</sup>The LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. <sup>3</sup>They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.’ <sup>4</sup>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and he told me to say: “This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind. <sup>6</sup>You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. <sup>8</sup>You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup>9</sup>I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you. <sup>10</sup>You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <sup>11</sup>This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. <sup>12</sup>And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?”</p>
<p><span>The Promise of Israel’s Return</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>15</sup>“Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, ‘They are far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.’</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.’</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>“They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. <sup>19</sup>I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. <sup>20</sup>Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. <sup>21</sup>But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. <sup>23</sup>The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it. <sup>24</sup>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia<a id="filepos7937948" href="062.html#filepos8262773"><sup>[17]</sup></a> in the vision given by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Then the vision I had seen went up from me, <sup>25</sup>and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.</p>

<h4>The Exile Symbolized</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>“Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. <sup>4</sup>During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile. <sup>5</sup>While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it. <sup>6</sup>Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites.”</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>In the morning the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>9</sup>“Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the Israelites who are there.’ <sup>11</sup>Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’</p>
<p>“As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>“The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land. <sup>13</sup>I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. <sup>14</sup>I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>“They will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. <sup>16</sup>But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>18</sup>“Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water. <sup>19</sup>Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. <sup>20</sup>The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p>
<h4>There Will Be No Delay</h4>
<p><sup>21</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>22</sup>“Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’? <sup>23</sup>Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Say to them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled. <sup>24</sup>For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel. <sup>25</sup>But I the LORD will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the Sovereign LORD.’ ”</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>27</sup>“Son of man, the Israelites are saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.’</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>“Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Sovereign LORD.’ ”</p>

<h4>False Prophets Condemned</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: ‘Hear the word of the LORD! <sup>3</sup>This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish<a id="filepos7945629" href="062.html#filepos8263134"><sup>[18]</sup></a> prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! <sup>4</sup>Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. <sup>5</sup>You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the LORD. <sup>6</sup>Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the LORD has not sent them, they say, “The LORD declares,” and expect him to fulfill their words. <sup>7</sup>Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, “The LORD declares,” though I have not spoken?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup>9</sup>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>“ ‘Because they lead my people astray, saying, “Peace,” when there is no peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash, <sup>11</sup>therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth. <sup>12</sup>When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, “Where is the whitewash you covered it with?”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury. <sup>14</sup>I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it<a id="filepos7948223" href="062.html#filepos8263375"><sup>[19]</sup></a> falls, you will be destroyed in it; and you will know that I am the LORD. <sup>15</sup>So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, “The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it, <sup>16</sup>those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Sovereign LORD.” ’</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>“Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them <sup>18</sup>and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own? <sup>19</sup>You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds. <sup>21</sup>I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <sup>22</sup>Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives, <sup>23</sup>therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>“Therefore say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!</p>

<p><span>Jerusalem’s Judgment Inescapable</span></p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>13</sup>“Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals, <sup>14</sup>even if these three men—Noah, Daniel<a id="filepos7954047" href="062.html#filepos8263737"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>

They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>“Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass throughout the land,’ and I kill its people and their animals, <sup>18</sup>as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters.

<p><sup>19</sup>“Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals, <sup id="filepos7955514">20</sup>as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter.

They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem—every disaster I have brought on it. <sup>23</sup>You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>

<p><span><sup>15</sup>“ ‘But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. <sup>16</sup>You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty.<a id="filepos7961949" href="062.html#filepos8264587"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
<sup>17</sup>You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. <sup>18</sup>And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. <sup>19</sup>Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD.</span></p>
<p><sup>20</sup>“ ‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? <sup>21</sup>You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. <sup>22</sup>In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, <sup>24</sup>you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup>25</sup>At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup>26</sup>You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup>27</sup>So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup>28</sup>You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. <sup>29</sup>Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia,<a id="filepos7964141" href="062.html#filepos8264870"><sup>[23]</sup></a> a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>“ ‘I am filled with fury against you,<a id="filepos7964452" href="062.html#filepos8265113"><sup>[24]</sup></a> declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! <sup>31</sup>When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>“ ‘You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! <sup>33</sup>All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. <sup>34</sup>So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>“ ‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! <sup>36</sup>This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood, <sup>37</sup>therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark naked. <sup>38</sup>I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. <sup>39</sup>Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you stark naked. <sup>40</sup>They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. <sup>41</sup>They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. <sup>42</sup>Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>“ ‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices?</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>“ ‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.” <sup>45</sup>You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <sup>46</sup>Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. <sup>47</sup>You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. <sup>48</sup>As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done.</p>
<p><sup>49</sup>“ ‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. <sup>50</sup>They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. <sup>51</sup>Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. <sup>52</sup>Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.</p>
<p><sup>53</sup>“ ‘However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, <sup>54</sup>so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. <sup>55</sup>And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. <sup>56</sup>You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, <sup>57</sup>before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom<a id="filepos7969912" href="062.html#filepos8265376"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you. <sup>58</sup>You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>“ ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. <sup>60</sup>Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. <sup>61</sup>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. <sup>62</sup>So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. <sup>63</sup>Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.’ ”</p>

<h4>Two Eagles and a Vine</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable. <sup>3</sup>Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: A great eagle with powerful wings, long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar, <sup>4</sup>he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>“ ‘He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow by abundant water, <sup>6</sup>and it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>“ ‘But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water. <sup>8</sup>It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches, bear fruit and become a splendid vine.’</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots. <sup>10</sup>It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?’ ”</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>12</sup>“Say to this rebellious people, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Say to them: ‘The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon. <sup>13</sup>Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land, <sup>14</sup>so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty. <sup>15</sup>But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape?</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>“ ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke. <sup>17</sup>Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives. <sup>18</sup>He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things, he shall not escape.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant. <sup>20</sup>I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there because he was unfaithful to me. <sup>21</sup>All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>“ ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain. <sup>23</sup>On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it; it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches. <sup>24</sup>All the trees of the forest will know that I the LORD bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish.</p>

<h4>The One Who Sins Will Die</h4>

<br/><div title="poetry">

<br/></div>
<p>Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>“But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things:</p>

<blockquote><p><sup>15</sup>“He does not eat at the mountain shrines</span></p></blockquote><p><span>or look to the idols of Israel.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He does not defile his neighbor’s wife.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>16</sup>He does not oppress anyone</span></p></blockquote><p><span>or require a pledge for a loan.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He does not commit robbery</span></p></blockquote><p><span>but gives his food to the hungry</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and provides clothing for the naked.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>17</sup>He withholds his hand from mistreating the poor</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and takes no interest or profit from them.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He keeps my laws and follows my decrees.</p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p>He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live. <sup>18</sup>But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>“Yet you ask, ‘Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. <sup>20</sup>The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>“But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die. <sup>22</sup>None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live. <sup>23</sup>Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>“But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? <sup>26</sup>If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die. <sup>27</sup>But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life. <sup>28</sup>Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die. <sup>29</sup>Yet the Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>“Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall. <sup>31</sup>Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel? <sup>32</sup>For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!</p>

<h4>Rebellious Israel Purged</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down in front of me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>3</sup>“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign LORD.’</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>“Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors <sup>5</sup>and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, “I am the LORD your God.” <sup>6</sup>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands. <sup>7</sup>And I said to them, “Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.”</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“ ‘But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt. <sup>9</sup>But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites. <sup>10</sup>Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. <sup>11</sup>I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person who obeys them will live. <sup>12</sup>Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the LORD made them holy.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>“ ‘Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws—by which the person who obeys them will live—and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness. <sup>14</sup>But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. <sup>15</sup>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands— <sup>16</sup>because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols. <sup>17</sup>Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness. <sup>18</sup>I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols. <sup>19</sup>I am the LORD your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. <sup>20</sup>Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.”</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>“ ‘But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, “The person who obeys them will live by them,” and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. <sup>22</sup>But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. <sup>23</sup>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries, <sup>24</sup>because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols. <sup>25</sup>So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live; <sup>26</sup>I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.’</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>“Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me: <sup>28</sup>When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings that aroused my anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings. <sup>29</sup>Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?’ ” (It is called Bamah<a id="filepos8005705" href="062.html#filepos8267118"><sup>[30]</sup></a> to this day.)</p>
<h4>Rebellious Israel Renewed</h4>
<p><sup>30</sup>“Therefore say to the Israelites: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will you defile yourselves the way your ancestors did and lust after their vile images? <sup>31</sup>When you offer your gifts—the sacrifice of your children in the fire—you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, you Israelites? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will not let you inquire of me.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>“ ‘You say, “We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone.” But what you have in mind will never happen. <sup>33</sup>As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will reign over you with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath. <sup id="filepos8007060">34</sup>I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered—with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath. <sup>35</sup>I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you. <sup>36</sup>As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup>37</sup>I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. <sup>38</sup>I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me.

<p><span>Judgment on Jerusalem’s Sins</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me:</p>
<br/><p><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices <sup>3</sup>and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols, <sup>4</sup>you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries. <sup>5</sup>Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>“ ‘See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood. <sup>7</sup>In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow. <sup>8</sup>You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup>9</sup>In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts. <sup>10</sup>In you are those who dishonor their father’s bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean. <sup>11</sup>In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor’s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter. <sup>12</sup>In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>“ ‘I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst. <sup>14</sup>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it. <sup>15</sup>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness. <sup>16</sup>When you have been defiled<a id="filepos8028135" href="062.html#filepos8268834"><sup>[35]</sup></a> in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>18</sup>“Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver. <sup>19</sup>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. <sup>20</sup>As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you. <sup>21</sup>I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her. <sup>22</sup>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath on you.’ ”</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Again the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>24</sup>“Son of man, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.’ <sup>25</sup>There is a conspiracy of her princes<a id="filepos8029758" href="062.html#filepos8269111"><sup>[36]</sup></a> within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her. <sup>26</sup>Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. <sup>27</sup>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. <sup>28</sup>Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says’—when the LORD has not spoken. <sup>29</sup>The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>“I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. <sup>31</sup>So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>

<h4>Two Adulterous Sisters</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. <sup id="filepos8031909">3</sup>They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. <sup>4</sup>The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors <sup>6</sup>clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. <sup>7</sup>She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. <sup>8</sup>She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>“Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. <sup>10</sup>They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. <sup>12</sup>She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. <sup>13</sup>I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.</p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>“But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans<a id="filepos8033951" href="062.html#filepos8269489"><sup>[37]</sup></a> portrayed in red, <sup>15</sup>with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea.<a id="filepos8034208" href="062.html#filepos8269736"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
<sup id="filepos8034295">16</sup>As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup>17</sup>Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup>18</sup>When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. <sup>19</sup>Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup>20</sup>There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. <sup>21</sup>So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.<a id="filepos8035126" href="062.html#filepos8270052"><sup>[39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><sup>22</sup>“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side— <sup>23</sup>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. <sup>24</sup>They will come against you with weapons,<a id="filepos8035855" href="062.html#filepos8270410"><sup>[40]</sup></a> chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. <sup>25</sup>I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. <sup>26</sup>They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. <sup>27</sup>So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>“For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. <sup>29</sup>They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity <sup>30</sup>have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. <sup>31</sup>You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>“You will drink your sister’s cup,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>a cup large and deep;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>it will bring scorn and derision,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>for it holds so much.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>33</sup>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the cup of ruin and desolation,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the cup of your sister Samaria.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>34</sup>You will drink it and drain it dry</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and chew on its pieces—</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and you will tear your breasts.</p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p>I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<br/><p><sup>35</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.”</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>The LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, <sup>37</sup>for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. <sup>38</sup>They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup>39</sup>On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>“They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry. <sup>41</sup>You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>“The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. <sup>43</sup>Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’ <sup>44</sup>And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. <sup>45</sup>But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder. <sup>47</sup>The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.</p>
<p><sup>48</sup>“So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. <sup>49</sup>You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.”</p>

Then you will know that I am the LORD. <sup>6</sup>For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel, <sup>7</sup>therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will wipe you out from among the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p>
<h4>A Prophecy Against Moab</h4>
<p><sup>8</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Look, Judah has become like all the other nations,” <sup>9</sup>therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim—the glory of that land. <sup>10</sup>I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations; <sup>11</sup>and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p>
<h4>A Prophecy Against Edom</h4>
<p><sup>12</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Edom took revenge on Judah and became very guilty by doing so, <sup>13</sup>therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword. <sup>14</sup>I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign LORD.’ ”</p>
<h4>A Prophecy Against Philistia</h4>
<p><sup>15</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah, <sup>16</sup>therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will wipe out the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast. <sup>17</sup>I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I take vengeance on them.’ ”</p>

<h4>A Prophecy Against Tyre</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>In the eleventh month of the twelfth<a id="filepos8058249" href="062.html#filepos8271168"><sup>[42]</sup></a> year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,’ <sup>3</sup>therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. <sup>4</sup>They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock. <sup>5</sup>Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. She will become plunder for the nations, <sup>6</sup>and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>“For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar<a id="filepos8059578" href="062.html#filepos8271496"><sup>[43]</sup></a> king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army. <sup>8</sup>He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you. <sup>9</sup>He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons. <sup>10</sup>His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through. <sup>11</sup>The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. <sup>12</sup>They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea. <sup>13</sup>I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. <sup>14</sup>I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>“This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you? <sup>16</sup>Then all the princes of the coast will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you. <sup>17</sup>Then they will take up a lament concerning you and say to you:</p>
