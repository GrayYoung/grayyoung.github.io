		<h4>Job</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Job replied:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Listen carefully to my words;</p>
			<p>let this be the consolation you give me.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Bear with me while I speak,</p>
			<p>and after I have spoken, mock on.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“Is my complaint directed to a human being?</p>
			<p>Why should I not be impatient?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Look at me and be appalled;</p>
			<p>clap your hand over your mouth.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>When I think about this, I am terrified;</p>
			<p>trembling seizes my body.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Why do the wicked live on,</p>
			<p>growing old and increasing in power?</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They see their children established around them,</p>
			<p>their offspring before their eyes.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Their homes are safe and free from fear;</p>
			<p>the rod of God is not on them.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Their bulls never fail to breed;</p>
			<p>their cows calve and do not miscarry.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>They send forth their children as a flock;</p>
			<p>their little ones dance about.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre;</p>
			<p>they make merry to the sound of the pipe.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>They spend their years in prosperity</p>
			<p>and go down to the grave in peace.<a id="filepos4165832" href="038.html#filepos4394812"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone!</p>
			<p>We have no desire to know your ways.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?</p>
			<p>What would we gain by praying to him?’</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>But their prosperity is not in their own hands,</p>
			<p>so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>“Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?</p>
			<p>How often does calamity come upon them,</p>
			<p>the fate God allots in his anger?</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>How often are they like straw before the wind,</p>
			<p>like chaff swept away by a gale?</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’</p>
			<p>Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it!</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Let their own eyes see their destruction;</p>
			<p>let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>For what do they care about the families they leave behind</p>
			<p>when their allotted months come to an end?</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>“Can anyone teach knowledge to God,</p>
			<p>since he judges even the highest?</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>One person dies in full vigor,</p>
			<p>completely secure and at ease,</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>well nourished in body,<a id="filepos4169964" href="038.html#filepos4395061"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
			<p>bones rich with marrow.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Another dies in bitterness of soul,</p>
			<p>never having enjoyed anything good.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Side by side they lie in the dust,</p>
			<p>and worms cover them both.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>“I know full well what you are thinking,</p>
			<p>the schemes by which you would wrong me.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great,</p>
			<p>the tents where the wicked lived?’</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Have you never questioned those who travel?</p>
			<p>Have you paid no regard to their accounts—</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity,</p>
			<p>that they are delivered from<a id="filepos4172352" href="038.html#filepos4395340"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the day of wrath?</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Who denounces their conduct to their face?</p>
			<p>Who repays them for what they have done?</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>They are carried to the grave,</p>
			<p>and watch is kept over their tombs.</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>The soil in the valley is sweet to them;</p>
			<p>everyone follows after them,</p>
			<p>and a countless throng goes<a id="filepos4173659" href="038.html#filepos4395653"><sup>[37]</sup></a> before them.</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>“So how can you console me with your nonsense?</p>
			<p>Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!”</p>

		<h4>Eliphaz</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Can a man be of benefit to God?</p>
			<p>Can even a wise person benefit him?</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous?</p>
			<p>What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“Is it for your piety that he rebukes you</p>
			<p>and brings charges against you?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Is not your wickedness great?</p>
			<p>Are not your sins endless?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>You demanded security from your relatives for no reason;</p>
			<p>you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>You gave no water to the weary</p>
			<p>and you withheld food from the hungry,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>though you were a powerful man, owning land—</p>
			<p>an honored man, living on it.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>And you sent widows away empty-handed</p>
			<p>and broke the strength of the fatherless.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>That is why snares are all around you,</p>
			<p>why sudden peril terrifies you,</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>why it is so dark you cannot see,</p>
			<p>and why a flood of water covers you.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Is not God in the heights of heaven?</p>
			<p>And see how lofty are the highest stars!</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Yet you say, ‘What does God know?</p>
			<p>Does he judge through such darkness?</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us</p>
			<p>as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Will you keep to the old path</p>
			<p>that the wicked have trod?</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>They were carried off before their time,</p>
			<p>their foundations washed away by a flood.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>They said to God, ‘Leave us alone!</p>
			<p>What can the Almighty do to us?’</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things,</p>
			<p>so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The righteous see their ruin and rejoice;</p>
			<p>the innocent mock them, saying,</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>‘Surely our foes are destroyed,</p>
			<p>and fire devours their wealth.’</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>“Submit to God and be at peace with him;</p>
			<p>in this way prosperity will come to you.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Accept instruction from his mouth</p>
			<p>and lay up his words in your heart.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored:</p>
			<p>If you remove wickedness far from your tent</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>and assign your nuggets to the dust,</p>
			<p>your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>then the Almighty will be your gold,</p>
			<p>the choicest silver for you.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty</p>
			<p>and will lift up your face to God.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>You will pray to him, and he will hear you,</p>
			<p>and you will fulfill your vows.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>What you decide on will be done,</p>
			<p>and light will shine on your ways.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’</p>
			<p>then he will save the downcast.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>He will deliver even one who is not innocent,</p>
			<p>who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”</p>

			<p><sup>17</sup>Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,</p>
			<p>by the thick darkness that covers my face.</p>

		<h4>Interlude: Where Wisdom Is Found</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>There is a mine for silver</p>
			<p>and a place where gold is refined.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Iron is taken from the earth,</p>
			<p>and copper is smelted from ore.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Mortals put an end to the darkness;</p>
			<p>they search out the farthest recesses</p>
			<p>for ore in the blackest darkness.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft,</p>
			<p>in places untouched by human feet;</p>
			<p>far from other people they dangle and sway.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The earth, from which food comes,</p>
			<p>is transformed below as by fire;</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>lapis lazuli comes from its rocks,</p>
			<p>and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>No bird of prey knows that hidden path,</p>
			<p>no falcon’s eye has seen it.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Proud beasts do not set foot on it,</p>
			<p>and no lion prowls there.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>People assault the flinty rock with their hands</p>
			<p>and lay bare the roots of the mountains.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>They tunnel through the rock;</p>
			<p>their eyes see all its treasures.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>They search<a id="filepos4222746" href="038.html#filepos4397431"><sup>[42]</sup></a> the sources of the rivers</p>
			<p>and bring hidden things to light.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>But where can wisdom be found?</p>
			<p>Where does understanding dwell?</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>No mortal comprehends its worth;</p>
			<p>it cannot be found in the land of the living.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The deep says, “It is not in me”;</p>
			<p>the sea says, “It is not with me.”</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>It cannot be bought with the finest gold,</p>
			<p>nor can its price be weighed out in silver.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,</p>
			<p>with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,</p>
			<p>nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;</p>
			<p>the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;</p>
			<p>it cannot be bought with pure gold.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Where then does wisdom come from?</p>
			<p>Where does understanding dwell?</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,</p>
			<p>concealed even from the birds in the sky.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Destruction<a id="filepos4226753" href="038.html#filepos4397714"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and Death say,</p>
			<p>“Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>God understands the way to it</p>
			<p>and he alone knows where it dwells,</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>for he views the ends of the earth</p>
			<p>and sees everything under the heavens.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>When he established the force of the wind</p>
			<p>and measured out the waters,</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>when he made a decree for the rain</p>
			<p>and a path for the thunderstorm,</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;</p>
			<p>he confirmed it and tested it.</p>

		<h4>Job’s Final Defense</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Job continued his discourse:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“How I long for the months gone by,</p>
			<p>for the days when God watched over me,</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>when his lamp shone on my head</p>
			<p>and by his light I walked through darkness!</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Oh, for the days when I was in my prime,</p>
			<p>when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>when the Almighty was still with me</p>
			<p>and my children were around me,</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>when my path was drenched with cream</p>
			<p>and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“When I went to the gate of the city</p>
			<p>and took my seat in the public square,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>the young men saw me and stepped aside</p>
			<p>and the old men rose to their feet;</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>the chief men refrained from speaking</p>
			<p>and covered their mouths with their hands;</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>the voices of the nobles were hushed,</p>
			<p>and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Whoever heard me spoke well of me,</p>
			<p>and those who saw me commended me,</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>because I rescued the poor who cried for help,</p>
			<p>and the fatherless who had none to assist them.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>The one who was dying blessed me;</p>
			<p>I made the widow’s heart sing.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>I put on righteousness as my clothing;</p>
			<p>justice was my robe and my turban.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>I was eyes to the blind</p>
			<p>and feet to the lame.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>I was a father to the needy;</p>
			<p>I took up the case of the stranger.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>I broke the fangs of the wicked</p>
			<p>and snatched the victims from their teeth.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>“I thought, ‘I will die in my own house,</p>
			<p>my days as numerous as the grains of sand.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>My roots will reach to the water,</p>
			<p>and the dew will lie all night on my branches.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>My glory will not fade;</p>
			<p>the bow will be ever new in my hand.’</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>“People listened to me expectantly,</p>
			<p>waiting in silence for my counsel.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>After I had spoken, they spoke no more;</p>
			<p>my words fell gently on their ears.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>They waited for me as for showers</p>
			<p>and drank in my words as the spring rain.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it;</p>
			<p>the light of my face was precious to them.<a id="filepos4237948" href="038.html#filepos4398075"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>I chose the way for them and sat as their chief;</p>
			<p>I dwelt as a king among his troops;</p>
			<p>I was like one who comforts mourners.</p>

		<p>and sets up others in their place.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Because he takes note of their deeds,</p>
		<p>he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>He punishes them for their wickedness</p>
		<p>where everyone can see them,</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>because they turned from following him</p>
		<p>and had no regard for any of his ways.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him,</p>
		<p>so that he heard the cry of the needy.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him?</p>
		<p>If he hides his face, who can see him?</p>
		<p>Yet he is over individual and nation alike,</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>to keep the godless from ruling,</p>
		<p>from laying snares for the people.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>“Suppose someone says to God,</p>

		<p><sup>32</sup>Teach me what I cannot see;</p>
		<p>if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>Should God then reward you on your terms,</p>
		<p>when you refuse to repent?</p>
		<p>You must decide, not I;</p>
		<p>so tell me what you know.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>“Men of understanding declare,</p>
		<p>wise men who hear me say to me,</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>‘Job speaks without knowledge;</p>
		<p>his words lack insight.’</p>
		<p><sup>36</sup>Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost</p>
		<p>for answering like a wicked man!</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>To his sin he adds rebellion;</p>
		<p>scornfully he claps his hands among us</p>
		<p>and multiplies his words against God.”</p>

		<p>If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>If you are righteous, what do you give to him,</p>
		<p>or what does he receive from your hand?</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself,</p>
		<p>and your righteousness only other people.</p>

		<p>they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</p>

		<p>because of the arrogance of the wicked.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea;</p>
		<p>the Almighty pays no attention to it.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>How much less, then, will he listen</p>
		<p>when you say that you do not see him,</p>
		<p>that your case is before him</p>
		<p>and you must wait for him,</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>and further, that his anger never punishes</p>
