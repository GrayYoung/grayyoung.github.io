		<h4>Job</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Job replied:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“Is my complaint directed to a human being?</p>
			<p>Why should I not be impatient?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Look at me and be appalled; clap your hand over your mouth.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not on them.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre; they make merry to the sound of the pipe.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.<a id="filepos4165832" href="038.html#filepos4394812"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone!</p>
			<p>We have no desire to know your ways.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?</p>
			<p>What would we gain by praying to him?’</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>“Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?</p>
			<p>How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’</p>
			<p>Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it!</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Let their own eyes see their destruction; let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>For what do they care about the families they leave behind when their allotted months come to an end?</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>“Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>One person dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease, <sup>24</sup>well nourished in body,<a id="filepos4169964" href="038.html#filepos4395061"><sup>[35]</sup></a> bones rich with marrow.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>“I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great, the tents where the wicked lived?’</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Have you never questioned those who travel?</p>
			<p>Have you paid no regard to their accounts—</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity, that they are delivered from<a id="filepos4172352" href="038.html#filepos4395340"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the day of wrath?</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Who denounces their conduct to their face?</p>
			<p>Who repays them for what they have done?</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>They are carried to the grave, and watch is kept over their tombs.</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>The soil in the valley is sweet to them; everyone follows after them, and a countless throng goes<a id="filepos4173659" href="038.html#filepos4395653"><sup>[37]</sup></a> before them.</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>“So how can you console me with your nonsense?</p>
			<p>Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!”</p>

		<h4>Eliphaz</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Can a man be of benefit to God?</p>
			<p>Can even a wise person benefit him?</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous?</p>
			<p>What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>“Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Is not your wickedness great?</p>
			<p>Are not your sins endless?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>You demanded security from your relatives for no reason; you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry, <sup>8</sup>though you were a powerful man, owning land—an honored man, living on it.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you, <sup>11</sup>why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Is not God in the heights of heaven?</p>
			<p>And see how lofty are the highest stars!</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Yet you say, ‘What does God know?</p>
			<p>Does he judge through such darkness?</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Will you keep to the old path that the wicked have trod?</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>They said to God, ‘Leave us alone!</p>
			<p>What can the Almighty do to us?’</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying, <sup>20</sup>‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.’</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>“Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored:</p>
			<p>If you remove wickedness far from your tent</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines, <sup>25</sup>then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then he will save the downcast.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>“Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment?</p>
		<p>Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>There are those who move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>They drive away the orphan’s donkey and take the widow’s ox in pledge.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>They crush olives among the terraces<a id="filepos4195639" href="038.html#filepos4396678"><sup>[40]</sup></a>; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help.</p>
		<p>But God charges no one with wrongdoing.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>“There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up, kills the poor and needy, and in the night steals forth like a thief.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’ and he keeps his face concealed.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>In the dark, thieves break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>For all of them, midnight is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>“Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; the wicked are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow they show no kindness.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>“If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?”</p>

		<h4>Job’s Final Word to His Friends</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>And Job continued his discourse:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter, <sup>3</sup>as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils, <sup>4</sup>my lips will not say anything wicked, and my tongue will not utter lies.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unjust!</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them?</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Will they find delight in the Almighty?</p>
			<p>Will they call on God at all times?</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>“I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>You have all seen this yourselves.</p>
			<p>Why then this meaningless talk?</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay, <sup>17</sup>what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.”</p>

		<h4>Interlude: Where Wisdom Is Found</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon’s eye has seen it.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>They search<a id="filepos4222746" href="038.html#filepos4397431"><sup>[42]</sup></a> the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>But where can wisdom be found?</p>
			<p>Where does understanding dwell?</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The deep says, “It is not in me”; the sea says, “It is not with me.”</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Where then does wisdom come from?</p>
			<p>Where does understanding dwell?</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Destruction<a id="filepos4226753" href="038.html#filepos4397714"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and Death say, “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells, <sup>24</sup>for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters, <sup>26</sup>when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm, <sup>27</sup>then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>And he said to the human race, “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.”</p>

		<p>Has not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>I go about blackened, but not by the sun;</p>
		<p>I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing.</p>

		<p><sup>12</sup>At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He brings the clouds to punish people, or to water his earth and show his love.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God’s wonders.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind, <sup>18</sup>can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>“Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Should he be told that I want to speak?</p>
		<p>Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;</p>
		<p>God comes in awesome majesty.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Therefore, people revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?<a id="filepos4330634" href="038.html#filepos4405487"><sup>[68]</sup></a>”</p>
