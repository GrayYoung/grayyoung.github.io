<p><span><span>A Call to Return to the <span>LORD</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo:</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>“The <span>LORD</span> was very angry with your ancestors. <sup>3</sup>Therefore tell the people: This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>4</sup>Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>5</sup>Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? <sup>6</sup>But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors?</span></p>
<p><span>“Then they repented and said, ‘The <span>LORD</span> Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Man Among the Myrtle Trees</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>I asked, “What are these, my lord?”</span></p>
<p><span>The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the <span>LORD</span> has sent to go throughout the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>And they reported to the angel of the <span>LORD</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Then the angel of the <span>LORD</span> said, “<span>LORD</span> Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?” <sup>13</sup>So the <span>LORD</span> spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, <sup>15</sup>and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>“Therefore this is what the <span>LORD</span> says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>“Proclaim further: This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the <span>LORD</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Four Horns and Four Craftsmen</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p id="filepos8997186"><span><sup>18</sup>Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. <sup>19</sup>I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?”</span></p>
<p><span>He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> showed me four craftsmen. <sup>21</sup>I asked, “What are these coming to do?”</span></p>
<p><span>He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”<a id="filepos8998211" href="#filepos9068484"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a></span></p>

<div>
<p id="filepos8998610"><span><sup>1</sup>Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand. <sup>2</sup>I asked, “Where are you going?”</span></p>
<p><span>He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him <sup>4</sup>and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it. <sup>5</sup>And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>, ‘and I will be its glory within.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!” <sup>8</sup>For this is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye— <sup>9</sup>I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them.<a id="filepos9000397" href="#filepos9069253"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a> Then you will know that the <span>LORD</span> Almighty has sent me.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>11</sup>“Many nations will be joined with the <span>LORD</span> in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the <span>LORD</span> Almighty has sent me to you. <sup>12</sup>The <span>LORD</span> will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem. <sup>13</sup>Be still before the <span>LORD</span>, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Clean Garments for the High Priest</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then he showed me Joshua<a id="filepos9001847" href="#filepos9069681"><span><sup>[4]</sup></span></a> the high priest standing before the angel of the <span>LORD</span>, and Satan<a id="filepos9002033" href="#filepos9069963"><span><sup>[5]</sup></span></a> standing at his right side to accuse him. <sup>2</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to Satan, “The <span>LORD</span> rebuke you, Satan! The <span>LORD</span>, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. <sup>4</sup>The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span>Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the <span>LORD</span> stood by.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>The angel of the <span>LORD</span> gave this charge to Joshua: <sup>7</sup>“This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>“ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. <sup>9</sup>See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes<a id="filepos9004076" href="#filepos9070229"><span><sup>[6]</sup></span></a> on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Gold Lampstand and the Two Olive Trees</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. <sup>2</sup>He asked me, “What do you see?”</span></p>
<p><span>I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. <sup id="filepos9005470">3</sup>Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”</span></p>
<p><span>“No, my lord,” I replied.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>So he said to me, “This is the word of the <span>LORD</span> to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>Then the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to me: <sup>9</sup>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the <span>LORD</span> Almighty has sent me to you.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the <span>LORD</span> that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone<a id="filepos9007411" href="#filepos9070587"><span><sup>[7]</sup></span></a> in the hand of Zerubbabel?”</span></p>
<p id="filepos9007566"><span><sup>11</sup>Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>13</sup>He replied, “Do you not know what these are?”</span></p>
<p><span>“No, my lord,” I said.</span></p>
<p id="filepos9008322"><span><sup>14</sup>So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to<a id="filepos9008454" href="#filepos9070835"><span><sup>[8]</sup></span></a> serve the Lord of all the earth.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Flying Scroll</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>He asked me, “What do you see?”</span></p>
<p><span>I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.<a id="filepos9009397" href="#filepos9071209"><span><sup>[9]</sup></span></a>”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. <sup>4</sup>The <span>LORD</span> Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Woman in a Basket</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>I asked, “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span>He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity<a id="filepos9010830" href="#filepos9071519"><span><sup>[10]</sup></span></a> of the people throughout the land.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! <sup>8</sup>He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>He replied, “To the country of Babylonia<a id="filepos9011924" href="#filepos9071763"><span><sup>[11]</sup></span></a> to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Four Chariots</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze. <sup>2</sup>The first chariot had red horses, the second black, <sup>3</sup>the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful. <sup>4</sup>I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits<a id="filepos9013060" href="#filepos9072127"><span><sup>[12]</sup></span></a> of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. <sup>6</sup>The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west,<a id="filepos9013353" href="#filepos9072366"><span><sup>[13]</sup></span></a> and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit<a id="filepos9013983" href="#filepos9072617"><span><sup>[14]</sup></span></a> rest in the land of the north.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>A Crown for Joshua</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>The word of the <span>LORD</span> came to me: <sup>10</sup>“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. <sup>11</sup>Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.<a id="filepos9014708" href="#filepos9072857"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a>
<sup>12</sup>Tell him this is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>13</sup>It is he who will build the temple of the <span>LORD</span>, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne.

<p><span><span>Justice and Mercy, Not Fasting</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev. <sup>2</sup>The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the <span>LORD</span>
<sup>3</sup>by asking the priests of the house of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>Then the word of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty came to me: <sup>5</sup>“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted? <sup>6</sup>And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves? <sup>7</sup>Are these not the words the <span>LORD</span> proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>And the word of the <span>LORD</span> came again to Zechariah: <sup>9</sup>“This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. <sup>10</sup>Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears. <sup>12</sup>They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the <span>LORD</span> Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the <span>LORD</span> Almighty was very angry.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>13</sup>“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>14</sup>‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The <span>LORD</span> Promises to Bless Jerusalem</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The word of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty came to me.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age. <sup>5</sup>The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west. <sup>8</sup>I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Now hear these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.’ This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. <sup>10</sup>Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor. <sup>11</sup>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people. <sup>13</sup>Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse<a id="filepos9022854" href="#filepos9074005"><span><sup>[19]</sup></span></a> among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing.<a id="filepos9023007" href="#filepos9074389"><span><sup>[20]</sup></span></a> Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,” says the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, <sup>15</sup>“so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid. <sup>16</sup>These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts; <sup>17</sup>do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>The word of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty came to me.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come, <sup>21</sup>and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the <span>LORD</span> and seek the <span>LORD</span> Almighty. I myself am going.’ <sup>22</sup>And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the <span>LORD</span> Almighty and to entreat him.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Two Shepherds</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter. <sup>5</sup>Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the <span>LORD</span>, I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them. <sup>6</sup>For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. <sup>8</sup>In one month I got rid of the three shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span>The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them <sup>9</sup>and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. <sup>11</sup>It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p id="filepos9051732"><span><sup>12</sup>I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p id="filepos9051970"><span><sup>13</sup>And the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd. <sup>16</sup>For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Jerusalem’s Enemies to Be Destroyed</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>A prophecy: The word of the <span>LORD</span> concerning Israel.</span></p>
<br/><p><span>The <span>LORD</span>, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: <sup>2</sup>“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. <sup>3</sup>On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. <sup>4</sup>On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. <sup>5</sup>Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the <span>LORD</span> Almighty is their God.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“The <span>LORD</span> will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah. <sup>8</sup>On that day the <span>LORD</span> will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the <span>LORD</span> going before them. <sup>9</sup>On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.</span></p>

<p id="filepos9056646"><span><sup>10</sup>“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit<a id="filepos9056812" href="#filepos9076275"><span><sup>[25]</sup></span></a> of grace and supplication.

<p><span><span>The <span>LORD</span> Comes and Reigns</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>A day of the <span>LORD</span> is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city. <sup>3</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. <sup>4</sup>On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. <sup>5</sup>You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake<a id="filepos9064032" href="#filepos9077527"><span><sup>[29]</sup></span></a> in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the <span>LORD</span> my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. <sup>7</sup>It will be a unique day—a day known only to the <span>LORD</span>—with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>The <span>LORD</span> will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one <span>LORD</span>, and his name the only name.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place. <sup>11</sup>It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>This is the plague with which the <span>LORD</span> will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. <sup>13</sup>On that day people will be stricken by the <span>LORD</span> with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. <sup>14</sup>Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. <sup>15</sup>A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. <sup>17</sup>If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, they will have no rain. <sup>18</sup>If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The <span>LORD</span><a id="filepos9067174" href="#filepos9077896"><span><sup>[30]</sup></span></a> will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. <sup>19</sup>This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>On that day <span><span>HOLY TO THE LORD</span></span> will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the <span>LORD</span>’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. <sup>21</sup>Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite<a id="filepos9068127" href="#filepos9078187"><span><sup>[31]</sup></span></a> in the house of the <span>LORD</span> Almighty.</span></p>
