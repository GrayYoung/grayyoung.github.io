		<p><sup>1</sup>How deserted lies the city, once so full of people!</p>
		<p>How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations!</p>
		<p>She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are on her cheeks.</p>
		<p>Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her.</p>
		<p>All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>After affliction and harsh labor,</p>
		<p>Judah has gone into exile.</p>
		<p>She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place.</p>
		<p>All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed festivals.</p>
		<p>All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease.</p>
		<p>The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins.</p>
		<p>Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>All the splendor has departed from Daughter Zion.</p>
		<p>Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>In the days of her affliction and wandering</p>
		<p>Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old.</p>
		<p>When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her.</p>
		<p>Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean.</p>
		<p>All who honored her despise her, for they have all seen her naked; she herself groans and turns away.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future.</p>
		<p>Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her.</p>
		<p>“Look, LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary—those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive.</p>
		<p>“Look, LORD, and consider, for I am despised.”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?</p>
		<p>Look around and see.</p>
		<p>Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>“From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones.</p>
		<p>He spread a net for my feet and turned me back.</p>
		<p>He made me desolate, faint all the day long.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“My sins have been bound into a yoke<a id="filepos7791716" href="#filepos7870972"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; by his hands they were woven together.</p>
		<p>They have been hung on my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength.</p>
		<p>He has given me into the hands of those I cannot withstand.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>“The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me</p>
		<p>to<a id="filepos7793230" href="#filepos7871293"><sup>[3]</sup></a> crush my young men.</p>
		<p>In his winepress the Lord has trampled</p>
		<p>Virgin Daughter Judah.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>“This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears.</p>
		<p>No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit.</p>
		<p>My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her.</p>
		<p>The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes;</p>
		<p>Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>“The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command.</p>
		<p>Listen, all you peoples; look on my suffering.</p>
		<p>My young men and young women have gone into exile.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>“I called to my allies but they betrayed me.</p>
		<p>My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>“See, LORD, how distressed I am!</p>
		<p>I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious.</p>
		<p>Outside, the sword bereaves;</p>
		<p>inside, there is only death.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>“People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me.</p>
		<p>All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done.</p>
		<p>May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>“Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins.</p>
		<p>My groans are many and my heart is faint.”</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with the cloud of his anger<a id="filepos7801166" href="#filepos7872008"><sup>[5]</sup></a>!</p>
		<p>He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of Daughter Judah.</p>
		<p>He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>In fierce anger he has cut off every horn<a id="filepos7803194" href="#filepos7872308"><sup>[6]</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="filepos7803291" href="#filepos7872585"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of Israel.</p>
		<p>He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy.</p>
		<p>He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready.</p>
		<p>Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel.</p>
		<p>He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds.</p>
		<p>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for Daughter Judah.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting.</p>
		<p>The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary.</p>
		<p>He has given the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed festival.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The LORD determined to tear down the wall around Daughter Zion.</p>
		<p>He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying.</p>
		<p>He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed.</p>
		<p>Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth.</p>
		<p>The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>My eyes fail from weeping,</p>
		<p>I am in torment within; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>They say to their mothers,</p>
		<p>“Where is bread and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers’ arms.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>What can I say for you?</p>
		<p>With what can I compare you,</p>
		<p>Daughter Jerusalem?</p>
		<p>To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you,</p>
		<p>Virgin Daughter Zion?</p>
		<p>Your wound is as deep as the sea.</p>
		<p>Who can heal you?</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity.</p>
		<p>The prophecies they gave you were false and misleading.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem:</p>
		<p>“Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, “We have swallowed her up.</p>
		<p>This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago.</p>
		<p>He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn<a id="filepos7818288" href="#filepos7872845"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of your foes.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord.</p>
		<p>You walls of Daughter Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord.</p>
		<p>Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at every street corner.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>“Look, LORD, and consider:</p>
		<p>Whom have you ever treated like this?</p>
		<p>Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for?</p>
		<p>Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>“Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword.</p>
		<p>You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>“As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side.</p>
		<p>In the day of the LORD’s anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed.”</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of the LORD’s wrath.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>He has filled me with bitter herbs and given me gall to drink.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>I have been deprived of peace;</p>
		<p>I have forgotten what prosperity is.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>So I say, “My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD.”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>I say to myself, “The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.”</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Let him bury his face in the dust—there may yet be hope.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>For no one is cast off by the Lord forever.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>to deny people their rights before the Most High,</p>
		<p><sup>36</sup>to deprive them of justice—would not the Lord see such things?</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?</p>
		<p><sup>38</sup>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>Why should the living complain when punished for their sins?</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>“We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>“You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.</p>
		<p><sup>44</sup>You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.</p>
		<p><sup>46</sup>“All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.</p>
		<p><sup>47</sup>We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction.”</p>
		<p><sup>48</sup>Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.</p>
		<p><sup>49</sup>My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,</p>
		<p><sup>50</sup>until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</p>
		<p><sup>51</sup>What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</p>
		<p><sup>52</sup>Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</p>
		<p><sup>53</sup>They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</p>
		<p><sup>54</sup>the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to perish.</p>
		<p><sup>55</sup>I called on your name, LORD, from the depths of the pit.</p>
		<p><sup>56</sup>You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears to my cry for relief.”</p>
		<p><sup>57</sup>You came near when I called you, and you said, “Do not fear.”</p>
		<p><sup>58</sup>You, Lord, took up my case; you redeemed my life.</p>
		<p><sup>59</sup>LORD, you have seen the wrong done to me.</p>
		<p>Uphold my cause!</p>
		<p><sup>60</sup>You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.</p>
		<p><sup>61</sup>LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me—</p>
		<p><sup>62</sup>what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.</p>
		<p><sup>63</sup>Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs.</p>
		<p><sup>64</sup>Pay them back what they deserve, LORD, for what their hands have done.</p>
		<p><sup>65</sup>Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!</p>
		<p><sup>66</sup>Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull!</p>
		<p>The sacred gems are scattered at every street corner.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>How the precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter’s hands!</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Because of thirst the infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets.</p>
		<p>Those brought up in royal purple now lie on ash heaps.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like lapis lazuli.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets.</p>
		<p>Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food when my people were destroyed.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger.</p>
		<p>He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the peoples of the world, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Now they grope through the streets as if they were blind.</p>
		<p>They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>“Go away! You are unclean!” people cry to them.</p>
		<p>“Away! Away! Don’t touch us!”</p>
		<p>When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say,</p>
		<p>“They can stay here no longer.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>The LORD himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them.</p>
		<p>The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>People stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets.</p>
		<p>Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>The LORD’s anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps.</p>
		<p>We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you who live in the land of Uz.</p>
		<p>But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Your punishment will end, Daughter Zion; he will not prolong your exile.</p>
		<p>But he will punish your sin, Daughter Edom, and expose your wickedness.</p>
