			<p><sup>2</sup>for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight;</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;</p>

		<h4>Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>8</sup>Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>If they say, “Come along with us;</p>
			<p>let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,</p>
			<p>let’s ambush some harmless soul;</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>let’s swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>cast lots with us; we will all share the loot”—</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it!</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves!</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it.</p>

		<h4>Wisdom’s Rebuke</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>20</sup>Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square;</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>on top of the wall<a id="filepos5642943" href="048.html#filepos5998561"><sup>[4]</sup></a> she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech:</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?</p>
			<p>How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Repent at my rebuke!</p>
			<p>Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,</p>
			<p>I will make known to you my teachings.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke,</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;</p>
			<p>I will mock when calamity overtakes you—</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>“Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me,</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”</p>

		<h4>Moral Benefits of Wisdom</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding—</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words,</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.<a id="filepos5654472" href="048.html#filepos5998954"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Surely her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.</p>

			<p><sup>1</sup>My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;</p>

			<p><sup>9</sup>Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.</p>
			<p id="filepos5660590"><sup>11</sup>My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline, and do not resent his rebuke,</p>

			<p><sup>13</sup>Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding,</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.</p>

			<p><sup>16</sup>Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>By wisdom the LORD laid the earth’s foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion;</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>for the LORD will be at your side and will keep your foot from being snared.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Do not say to your neighbor,</p>
			<p>“Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—when you already have it with you.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>Do not accuse anyone for no reason—when they have done you no harm.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Do not envy the violent or choose any of their ways.</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>For the LORD detests the perverse but takes the upright into his confidence.</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>The LORD’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</p>
			<p id="filepos5669242"><sup>34</sup>He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.</p>
			<p><sup>35</sup>The wise inherit honor, but fools get only shame.</p>

			<p><sup>1</sup>Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>For I too was a son to my father, still tender, and cherished by my mother.</p>

			<p><sup>6</sup>Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The beginning of wisdom is this: Get<a id="filepos5672686" href="048.html#filepos6000005"><sup>[8]</sup></a> wisdom.</p>

			<p><sup>11</sup>I instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;</p>

		<h4>Warning Against Adultery</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>My son, pay attention to my wisdom, turn your ear to my words of insight,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;</p>

			<p><sup>7</sup>Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>lest you lose your honor to others and your dignity<a id="filepos5683674" href="048.html#filepos6000897"><sup>[11]</sup></a> to one who is cruel,</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>You will say, “How I hated discipline!</p>
			<p>How my heart spurned correction!</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my instructors.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God’s people.”</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>A loving doe, a graceful deer—may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?</p>
			<p>Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>For your ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all your paths.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them; the cords of their sins hold them fast.</p>

		<h4>Warnings Against Folly</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands:</p>
			<p>Go—to the point of exhaustion—<a id="filepos5690560" href="048.html#filepos6001254"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and give your neighbor no rest!</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>How long will you lie there, you sluggard?</p>
			<p>When will you get up from your sleep?</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>A troublemaker and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>who winks maliciously with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>who plots evil with deceit in his heart—he always stirs up conflict.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.</p>

		<h4>Warning Against Adultery</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>20</sup>My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life,</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>keeping you from your neighbor’s wife, from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man’s wife preys on your very life.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself.</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away.</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.</p>
			<p><sup>35</sup>He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.</p>

			<p><sup>20</sup>He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.”</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer<a id="filepos5711377" href="048.html#filepos6001629"><sup>[13]</sup></a> stepping into a noose<a id="filepos5711485" href="048.html#filepos6001902"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.</p>

		<p><sup>33</sup>Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the LORD, and humility comes before honor.</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>To humans belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the proper answer of the tongue.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>All a person’s ways seem pure to them, but motives are weighed by the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The LORD works out everything to its proper end—even the wicked for a day of disaster.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The LORD detests all the proud of heart.</p>
		<p>Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the LORD evil is avoided.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>When the LORD takes pleasure in anyone’s way, he causes their enemies to make peace with them.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth does not betray justice.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Honest scales and balances belong to the LORD; all the weights in the bag are of his making.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne is established through righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Kings take pleasure in honest lips; they value the one who speaks what is right.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>A king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but the wise will appease it.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>When a king’s face brightens, it means life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The highway of the upright avoids evil; those who guard their ways preserve their lives.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers,<a id="filepos5812855" href="048.html#filepos6007976"><sup>[31]</sup></a> and blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The wise in heart are called discerning, and gracious words promote instruction.<a id="filepos5813512" href="048.html#filepos6008255"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Prudence is a fountain of life to the prudent, but folly brings punishment to fools.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The hearts of the wise make their mouths prudent, and their lips promote instruction.<a id="filepos5814331" href="048.html#filepos6008521"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>The appetite of laborers works for them; their hunger drives them on.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>A scoundrel plots evil, and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>A perverse person stirs up conflict, and a gossip separates close friends.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>A violent person entices their neighbor and leads them down a path that is not good.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Whoever winks with their eye is plotting perversity; whoever purses their lips is bent on evil.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained in the way of righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.</p>
