		<h4>The Beginning</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>2</sup>Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
		<div>
			<p id="filepos276815"><sup>3</sup>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <sup>4</sup>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup>5</sup>God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” <sup>7</sup>So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. <sup>8</sup>God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. <sup>10</sup>God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. <sup>12</sup>The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup>13</sup>And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, <sup>15</sup>and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. <sup>16</sup>God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup>17</sup>God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup>18</sup>to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup>19</sup>And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” <sup>21</sup>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup>22</sup>God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” <sup>23</sup>And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup>25</sup>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,<a id="filepos280969" href="009.html#filepos644238"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”</p>
		</div>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p id="filepos281186"><sup>27</sup>So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them;  male and female he created them.</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><sup>28</sup>God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup>30</sup>And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.</p>

	<p><sup>1</sup>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.</p>
	<p id="filepos283222"><sup>2</sup>By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. <sup>3</sup>Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.</p>

		<h4>Adam and Eve</h4>
		<p><sup>4</sup>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth<a id="filepos284102" href="009.html#filepos644669"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and no plant had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, <sup id="filepos284345">6</sup>but streams<a id="filepos284368" href="009.html#filepos644976"><sup>[3]</sup></a> came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. <sup id="filepos284522">7</sup>Then the LORD God formed a man<a id="filepos284600" href="009.html#filepos645213"><sup>[4]</sup></a> from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. <sup>9</sup>The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. <sup>11</sup>The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup>12</sup>(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin<a id="filepos285695" href="009.html#filepos645642"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and onyx are also there.) <sup>13</sup>The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.<a id="filepos285904" href="009.html#filepos645895"><sup>[6]</sup></a> <sup>14</sup>The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. <sup>16</sup>And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; <sup>17</sup>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup id="filepos287273">20</sup>So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.</p>
		<p>But for Adam<a id="filepos287487" href="009.html#filepos646149"><sup>[7]</sup></a> no suitable helper was found. <sup>21</sup>So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs<a id="filepos287772" href="009.html#filepos646390"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and then closed up the place with flesh. <sup>22</sup>Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib<a id="filepos287991" href="009.html#filepos646657"><sup>[9]</sup></a> he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The man said,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p id="filepos288977"><sup>24</sup>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</p>

		<h4>The Fall</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, <sup>3</sup>but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. <sup>5</sup>“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. <sup>7</sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. <sup>9</sup>But the LORD God called to the man, “Where are you?”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”</p>
		<p>The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>So the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. <sup>15</sup>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring<a id="filepos294176" href="009.html#filepos647012"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and hers; he will crush<a id="filepos294412" href="009.html#filepos647251"><sup>[11]</sup></a> your head, and you will strike his heel.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>16</sup>To the woman he said,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>17</sup>To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. <sup>18</sup>It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. <sup>19</sup>By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Adam<a id="filepos297781" href="009.html#filepos647492"><sup>[12]</sup></a> named his wife Eve,<a id="filepos297887" href="009.html#filepos647734"><sup>[13]</sup></a> because she would become the mother of all the living.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. <sup>22</sup>And the LORD God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.” <sup>23</sup>So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. <sup>24</sup>After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side<a id="filepos298725" href="009.html#filepos647999"><sup>[14]</sup></a> of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>

		<h4>Cain and Abel</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Adam<a id="filepos299350" href="009.html#filepos648366"><sup>[15]</sup></a> made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.<a id="filepos299511" href="009.html#filepos648607"><sup>[16]</sup></a> She said, “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth<a id="filepos299697" href="009.html#filepos648910"><sup>[17]</sup></a> a man.” <sup>2</sup>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.</p>
		<p>Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. <sup>3</sup>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. <sup>4</sup>And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, <sup>5</sup>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? <sup>7</sup>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”<a id="filepos301061" href="009.html#filepos649157"><sup>[18]</sup></a> While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”</p>
		<p>“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>The LORD said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. <sup>11</sup>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <sup id="filepos302032">12</sup>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is more than I can bear. <sup id="filepos302383">14</sup>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>But the LORD said to him, “Not so<a id="filepos302749" href="009.html#filepos649517"><sup>[19]</sup></a>; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. <sup>16</sup>So Cain went out from the LORD’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,<a id="filepos303146" href="009.html#filepos649797"><sup>[20]</sup></a> east of Eden.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. <sup>18</sup>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. <sup>20</sup>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. <sup>21</sup>His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. <sup>22</sup>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of<a id="filepos304139" href="009.html#filepos650185"><sup>[21]</sup></a> bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Lamech said to his wives,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. <sup>24</sup>If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,<a id="filepos305637" href="009.html#filepos650450"><sup>[22]</sup></a> saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” <sup>26</sup>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.</p>
		<p>At that time people began to call on<a id="filepos306012" href="009.html#filepos650717"><sup>[23]</sup></a> the name of the LORD.</p>

		<h4>Wickedness in the World</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup>2</sup>the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup>3</sup>Then the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with<a id="filepos311665" href="009.html#filepos652061"><sup>[27]</sup></a> humans forever, for they are mortal<a id="filepos311787" href="009.html#filepos652323"><sup>[28]</sup></a>; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. <sup>6</sup>The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. <sup>7</sup>So the LORD said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” <sup>8</sup>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

		<h4>Noah and the Flood</h4>

		<p>Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. <sup>10</sup>Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. <sup>12</sup>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup>13</sup>So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup id="filepos314099">14</sup>So make yourself an ark of cypress<a id="filepos314146" href="009.html#filepos652564"><sup>[29]</sup></a> wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup>15</sup>This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.<a id="filepos314426" href="009.html#filepos652842"><sup>[30]</sup></a> <sup>16</sup>Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit<a id="filepos314589" href="009.html#filepos653186"><sup>[31]</sup></a> high all around.<a id="filepos314692" href="009.html#filepos653459"><sup>[32]</sup></a> Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup>17</sup>I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup>18</sup>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. <sup>19</sup>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup>20</sup>Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup>21</sup>You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>The LORD then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. <sup>2</sup>Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, <sup>3</sup>and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. <sup>4</sup>Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.”</p>

		<p><sup>6</sup>Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. <sup>7</sup>And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. <sup>8</sup>Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, <sup>9</sup>male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. <sup>10</sup>And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. <sup>12</sup>And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark. <sup>14</sup>They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. <sup>15</sup>Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. <sup>16</sup>The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. <sup>18</sup>The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. <sup>19</sup>They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. <sup>20</sup>The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.<a id="filepos319140" href="009.html#filepos653856"><sup>[33]</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="filepos319238" href="009.html#filepos654123"><sup>[34]</sup></a> <sup>21</sup>Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. <sup>22</sup>Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. <sup>23</sup>Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. <sup>2</sup>Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. <sup>3</sup>The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, <sup>4</sup>and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. <sup>5</sup>The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark <sup>7</sup>and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. <sup>8</sup>Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. <sup>9</sup>But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. <sup>10</sup>He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. <sup>11</sup>When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. <sup>12</sup>He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. <sup>14</sup>By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Then God said to Noah, <sup>16</sup>“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. <sup>17</sup>Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. <sup>19</sup>All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. <sup>21</sup>The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though<a id="filepos323629" href="009.html#filepos654536"><sup>[35]</sup></a> every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood.

		<h4>God’s Covenant With Noah</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. <sup>2</sup>The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. <sup>3</sup>Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. <sup>5</sup>And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.</p>

		<p><sup>7</sup>As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: <sup>9</sup>“I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you <sup>10</sup>and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. <sup>11</sup>I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: <sup>13</sup>I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup>Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, <sup>15</sup>I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind.

		<h4>The Sons of Noah</h4>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) <sup>19</sup>These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded<a id="filepos329268" href="009.html#filepos654899"><sup>[36]</sup></a> to plant a vineyard. <sup>21</sup>When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. <sup>22</sup>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside. <sup>23</sup>But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, <sup>25</sup>he said,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.”</p>

		</div>
		<p><sup>26</sup>He also said,</p>

The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. <sup>9</sup>Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) <sup>11</sup>So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: <sup>12</sup>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. <sup>13</sup>Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. <sup id="filepos355561">15</sup>All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring<a id="filepos355637" href="009.html#filepos662607"><sup>[57]</sup></a> forever. <sup id="filepos355733">16</sup>I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. <sup>17</sup>Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the LORD.</p>

		<h4>Abram Rescues Lot</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar,<a id="filepos356725" href="009.html#filepos663036"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim, <sup>2</sup>these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). <sup>3</sup>All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley). <sup>4</sup>For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim <sup>6</sup>and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. <sup>7</sup>Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim <sup id="filepos358145">9</sup>against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. <sup>10</sup>Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. <sup>11</sup>The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away. <sup>12</sup>They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother<a id="filepos358937" href="009.html#filepos663349"><sup>[59]</sup></a> of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram. <sup>14</sup>When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan. <sup>15</sup>During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. <sup>16</sup>He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, <sup>19</sup>and he blessed Abram, saying,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. <sup>20</sup>And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p>Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, <sup>23</sup>that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ <sup>24</sup>I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”</p>

		<h4>The LORD’s Covenant With Abram</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision:</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield,<a id="filepos362654" href="009.html#filepos663732"><sup>[60]</sup></a> your very great reward.<a id="filepos362890" href="009.html#filepos663976"><sup>[61]</sup></a>”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>2</sup>But Abram said, “Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit<a id="filepos363269" href="009.html#filepos664251"><sup>[62]</sup></a> my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” <sup>3</sup>And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” <sup id="filepos363808">5</sup>He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring<a id="filepos363990" href="009.html#filepos664531"><sup>[63]</sup></a> be.”</p>
		<p id="filepos364123"><sup>6</sup>Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>He also said to him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>But Abram said, “Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>So the LORD said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. <sup>11</sup>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. <sup id="filepos365663">13</sup>Then the LORD said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. <sup id="filepos365906">14</sup>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. <sup>15</sup>You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. <sup>16</sup>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. <sup>18</sup>On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi<a id="filepos366672" href="009.html#filepos664770"><sup>[64]</sup></a> of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— <sup>19</sup>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, <sup>20</sup>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, <sup>21</sup>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”</p>

		<h4>Hagar and Ishmael</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; <sup>2</sup>so she said to Abram, “The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.”</p>
		<p>Abram agreed to what Sarai said. <sup>3</sup>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. <sup>4</sup>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.</p>
		<p>When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. <sup>5</sup>Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. <sup>8</sup>And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”</p>
		<p>“I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then the angel of the LORD told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.” <sup>10</sup>The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The angel of the LORD also said to her:</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael,<a id="filepos370318" href="009.html#filepos665129"><sup>[65]</sup></a> for the LORD has heard of your misery. <sup>12</sup>He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward<a id="filepos371404" href="009.html#filepos665393"><sup>[66]</sup></a> all his brothers.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>13</sup>She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen<a id="filepos371817" href="009.html#filepos665650"><sup>[67]</sup></a> the One who sees me.” <sup>14</sup>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi<a id="filepos371991" href="009.html#filepos665902"><sup>[68]</sup></a>; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. <sup>16</sup>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</p>

		<h4>The Covenant of Circumcision</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty<a id="filepos372963" href="009.html#filepos666316"><sup>[69]</sup></a>; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. <sup>2</sup>Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, <sup>4</sup>“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. <sup id="filepos373454">5</sup>No longer will you be called Abram<a id="filepos373500" href="009.html#filepos666565"><sup>[70]</sup></a>; your name will be Abraham,<a id="filepos373614" href="009.html#filepos666831"><sup>[71]</sup></a> for I have made you a father of many nations. <sup>6</sup>I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. <sup>7</sup>I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. <sup>8</sup>The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come. <sup>10</sup>This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. <sup>11</sup>You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. <sup>12</sup>For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring. <sup>13</sup>Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. <sup>14</sup>Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. <sup>16</sup>I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?” <sup>18</sup>And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.<a id="filepos376249" href="009.html#filepos667108"><sup>[72]</sup></a> I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. <sup>20</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. <sup>21</sup>But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.” <sup>22</sup>When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. <sup>24</sup>Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, <sup>25</sup>and his son Ishmael was thirteen; <sup>26</sup>Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day. <sup>27</sup>And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.</p>

		<h4>The Three Visitors</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. <sup>2</sup>Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,<a id="filepos378417" href="009.html#filepos667488"><sup>[73]</sup></a> do not pass your servant by. <sup>4</sup>Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. <sup>5</sup>Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”</p>
		<p>“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs<a id="filepos379156" href="009.html#filepos667733"><sup>[74]</sup></a> of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. <sup>8</sup>He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.</p>
		<p>“There, in the tent,” he said.</p>
		<p id="filepos380029"><sup>10</sup>Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.”</p>
		<p>Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. <sup>11</sup>Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. <sup>12</sup>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’ <sup id="filepos380922">14</sup>Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”</p>

		<p>But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”</p>

		<h4>Abraham Pleads for Sodom</h4>
		<p><sup>16</sup>When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. <sup>17</sup>Then the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? <sup id="filepos381911">18</sup>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.<a id="filepos382033" href="009.html#filepos668013"><sup>[75]</sup></a> <sup>19</sup>For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous <sup>21</sup>that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.<a id="filepos383055" href="009.html#filepos668344"><sup>[76]</sup></a> <sup>23</sup>Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup>24</sup>What if there are fifty righteous people in the city?

Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”</p>
		<p id="filepos383757"><sup>26</sup>The LORD said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, <sup>28</sup>what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”</p>
		<p>“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”</p>
		<p>He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”</p>
		<p>He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”</p>
		<p>He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”</p>
		<p>He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”</p>

			<h4>Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup>The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup>2</sup>“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”</p>
			<p>“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup>4</sup>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. <sup>5</sup>They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup>7</sup>and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing. <sup>8</sup>Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup>11</sup>Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup>13</sup>because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry<a id="filepos389728" href="009.html#filepos669142"><sup>[78]</sup></a> his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup>17</sup>As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,<a id="filepos390991" href="009.html#filepos669393"><sup>[79]</sup></a> please! <sup>19</sup>Your<a id="filepos391103" href="009.html#filepos669660"><sup>[80]</sup></a> servant has found favor in your<a id="filepos391221" href="009.html#filepos669909"><sup>[81]</sup></a> eyes, and you<a id="filepos391321" href="009.html#filepos670158"><sup>[82]</sup></a> have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die. <sup>20</sup>Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup>22</sup>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.<a id="filepos392072" href="009.html#filepos670407"><sup>[83]</sup></a>)</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup>24</sup>Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup>25</sup>Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. <sup>26</sup>But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup>28</sup>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.</p>
		</section>

			<h4>Lot and His Daughters</h4>
			<p><sup>30</sup>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup>31</sup>One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth. <sup>32</sup>Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.” <sup>35</sup>So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</p>
			<p><sup>36</sup>So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup>37</sup>The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab<a id="filepos395182" href="009.html#filepos670664"><sup>[84]</sup></a>; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup>38</sup>The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi<a id="filepos395389" href="009.html#filepos670948"><sup>[85]</sup></a>; he is the father of the Ammonites<a id="filepos395510" href="009.html#filepos671235"><sup>[86]</sup></a> of today.</p>

		<h4>Abraham and Abimelek</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, <sup>2</sup>and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? <sup>5</sup>Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. <sup>7</sup>Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. <sup>9</sup>Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.” <sup>10</sup>And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ <sup>12</sup>Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. <sup>13</sup>And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. <sup>15</sup>And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels<a id="filepos399155" href="009.html#filepos671603"><sup>[87]</sup></a> of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again, <sup>18</sup>for the LORD had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah.</p>

		<h4>The Birth of Isaac</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised. <sup>2</sup>Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. <sup>3</sup>Abraham gave the name Isaac<a id="filepos400514" href="009.html#filepos671993"><sup>[88]</sup></a> to the son Sarah bore him. <sup>4</sup>When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. <sup>5</sup>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.” <sup>7</sup>And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</h4>
		<p><sup>8</sup>The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. <sup>9</sup>But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, <sup id="filepos401606">10</sup>and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. <sup id="filepos401960">12</sup>But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring<a id="filepos402144" href="009.html#filepos672254"><sup>[89]</sup></a> will be reckoned. <sup>13</sup>I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. <sup>16</sup>Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she<a id="filepos403018" href="009.html#filepos672494"><sup>[90]</sup></a> began to sob.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. <sup>18</sup>Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. <sup>21</sup>While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.</p>

		<h4>The Treaty at Beersheba</h4>
		<p><sup>22</sup>At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. <sup>23</sup>Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Abraham said, “I swear it.”</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized. <sup>26</sup>But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty. <sup>28</sup>Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, <sup>29</sup>and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>So that place was called Beersheba,<a id="filepos405900" href="009.html#filepos672755"><sup>[91]</sup></a> because the two men swore an oath there.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. <sup>33</sup>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. <sup>34</sup>And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.</p>

		<h4>Abraham Tested</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”</p>
		<p>“Here I am,” he replied.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. <sup>4</sup>On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. <sup>5</sup>He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, <sup>7</sup>Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, my son?” Abraham replied.</p>
		<p>“The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <sup>10</sup>Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. <sup>11</sup>But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!”</p>
		<p>“Here I am,” he replied.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram<a id="filepos410075" href="009.html#filepos673230"><sup>[92]</sup></a> caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. <sup>14</sup>So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time <sup>16</sup>and said, “I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup id="filepos410895">17</sup>I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, <sup id="filepos411097">18</sup>and through your offspring<a id="filepos411136" href="009.html#filepos673610"><sup>[93]</sup></a> all nations on earth will be blessed,<a id="filepos411260" href="009.html#filepos673850"><sup>[94]</sup></a> because you have obeyed me.”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.</p>

		<h4>Nahor’s Sons</h4>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: <sup>21</sup>Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), <sup>22</sup>Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.” <sup>23</sup>Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.

		<h4>The Death of Sarah</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. <sup>2</sup>She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.<a id="filepos413103" href="009.html#filepos674342"><sup>[95]</sup></a> He said, <sup>4</sup>“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”</p>
		<p id="filepos413369"><sup>5</sup>The Hittites replied to Abraham, <sup>6</sup>“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”</p>
		<p id="filepos413695"><sup>7</sup>Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. <sup>8</sup>He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf <sup>9</sup>so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”</p>
		<p id="filepos414218"><sup>10</sup>Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. <sup>11</sup>“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give<a id="filepos414517" href="009.html#filepos674958"><sup>[96]</sup></a> you the field, and I give<a id="filepos414629" href="009.html#filepos675198"><sup>[97]</sup></a> you the cave that is in it. I give<a id="filepos414750" href="009.html#filepos675438"><sup>[98]</sup></a> it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land <sup>13</sup>and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Ephron answered Abraham, <sup>15</sup>“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels<a id="filepos415459" href="009.html#filepos675678"><sup>[99]</sup></a> of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”</p>
		<p id="filepos415652"><sup>16</sup>Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded <sup id="filepos416198">18</sup>to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. <sup>19</sup>Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. <sup id="filepos416458">20</sup>So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.</p>

		<h4>Isaac and Rebekah</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Abraham was now very old, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. <sup>2</sup>He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh. <sup>3</sup>I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, <sup>4</sup>but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said. <sup id="filepos418011">7</sup>“The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring<a id="filepos418241" href="009.html#filepos676069"><sup>[100]</sup></a> I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. <sup>8</sup>If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” <sup>9</sup>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim<a id="filepos418994" href="009.html#filepos676309"><sup>[101]</sup></a> and made his way to the town of Nahor. <sup>11</sup>He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Then he prayed, “LORD, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. <sup>13</sup>See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. <sup>14</sup>May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. <sup>16</sup>The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.” <sup>20</sup>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. <sup>21</sup>Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka<a id="filepos421587" href="009.html#filepos676566"><sup>[102]</sup></a> and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.<a id="filepos421719" href="009.html#filepos676836"><sup>[103]</sup></a> <sup>23</sup>Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.” <sup>25</sup>And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, <sup>27</sup>saying, “Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things. <sup>29</sup>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. <sup>30</sup>As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. <sup>31</sup>“Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. <sup>33</sup>Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.”</p>
		<p>“Then tell us,” Laban said.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. <sup>35</sup>The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. <sup>36</sup>My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. <sup>37</sup>And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <sup>38</sup>but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>“He replied, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family. <sup>41</sup>You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. <sup>43</sup>See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,” <sup>44</sup>and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master’s son.’</p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’</p>
		<p><sup>46</sup>“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also.</p>
		<p><sup>47</sup>“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’</p>
		<p>“She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’</p>
		<p>“Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, <sup>48</sup>and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son. <sup>49</sup>Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.”</p>
		<p><sup>50</sup>Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. <sup>51</sup>Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed.”</p>
		<p><sup>52</sup>When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. <sup>53</sup>Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. <sup>54</sup>Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.</p>
		<p>When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”</p>
		<p><sup>55</sup>But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you<a id="filepos429122" href="009.html#filepos677105"><sup>[104]</sup></a> may go.”</p>
		<p><sup>56</sup>But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.”</p>
		<p><sup>57</sup>Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.” <sup>58</sup>So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?”</p>
		<p>“I will go,” she said.</p>
		<p><sup>59</sup>So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. <sup>60</sup>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>61</sup>Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.</p>
		<p><sup>62</sup>Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. <sup>63</sup>He went out to the field one evening to meditate,<a id="filepos431375" href="009.html#filepos677345"><sup>[105]</sup></a> and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. <sup>64</sup>Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel <sup>65</sup>and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?”</p>
		<p>“He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.</p>
		<p><sup>66</sup>Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. <sup>67</sup>Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah. <sup>2</sup>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. <sup>3</sup>Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites. <sup>4</sup>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. <sup>6</sup>But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years. <sup>8</sup>Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people. <sup>9</sup>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, <sup>10</sup>the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites.<a id="filepos433826" href="009.html#filepos677743"><sup>[106]</sup></a> There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah. <sup>11</sup>After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.</p>

		<h4>Ishmael’s Sons</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, <sup>14</sup>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, <sup>15</sup>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. <sup>16</sup>These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps. <sup>17</sup>Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people. <sup>18</sup>His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward<a id="filepos435211" href="009.html#filepos678003"><sup>[107]</sup></a> all the tribes related to them.</p>

		<h4>Jacob and Esau</h4>
		<p><sup>19</sup>This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac.</p>
		<p>Abraham became the father of Isaac, <sup>20</sup>and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram<a id="filepos435882" href="009.html#filepos678260"><sup>[108]</sup></a> and sister of Laban the Aramean.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. <sup>22</sup>The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the LORD.</p>
		<p id="filepos436548"><sup>23</sup>The LORD said to her,</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”</p>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p><sup>24</sup>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. <sup>25</sup>The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.<a id="filepos437701" href="009.html#filepos678517"><sup>[109]</sup></a> <sup>26</sup>After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.<a id="filepos437900" href="009.html#filepos678778"><sup>[110]</sup></a> Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. <sup>28</sup>Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. <sup>30</sup>He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.<a id="filepos438723" href="009.html#filepos679089"><sup>[111]</sup></a>)</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.</p>
		<p>So Esau despised his birthright.</p>

		<h4>Isaac and Abimelek</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. <sup>2</sup>The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. <sup>3</sup>Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. <sup id="filepos440705">4</sup>I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring<a id="filepos440844" href="009.html#filepos679463"><sup>[112]</sup></a> all nations on earth will be blessed,<a id="filepos440969" href="009.html#filepos679703"><sup>[113]</sup></a> <sup>5</sup>because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.” <sup>6</sup>So Isaac stayed in Gerar.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. <sup>9</sup>So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?”</p>
		<p>Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him. <sup>13</sup>The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. <sup>14</sup>He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. <sup>15</sup>So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled. <sup>18</sup>Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. <sup>20</sup>But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,<a id="filepos444237" href="009.html#filepos680077"><sup>[114]</sup></a> because they disputed with him. <sup>21</sup>Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.<a id="filepos444459" href="009.html#filepos680337"><sup>[115]</sup></a> <sup>22</sup>He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,<a id="filepos444656" href="009.html#filepos680602"><sup>[116]</sup></a> saying, “Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land.”</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>From there he went up to Beersheba. <sup>24</sup>That night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. <sup>27</sup>Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>They answered, “We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you <sup>29</sup>that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the LORD.”</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. <sup>31</sup>Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!” <sup>33</sup>He called it Shibah,<a id="filepos447052" href="009.html#filepos680863"><sup>[117]</sup></a> and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.<a id="filepos447196" href="009.html#filepos681141"><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

		<h4>Jacob Takes Esau’s Blessing</h4>
		<p><sup>34</sup>When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. <sup>35</sup>They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section id="filepos447776">
	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos26892">Genesis 27</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”</p>
	<p>“Here I am,” he answered.</p>
	<p><sup>2</sup>Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death. <sup>3</sup>Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. <sup>4</sup>Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.”</p>
	<p><sup>5</sup>Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, <sup>6</sup>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, <sup>7</sup>‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.’ <sup>8</sup>Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: <sup>9</sup>Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. <sup>10</sup>Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.”</p>
	<p><sup>11</sup>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. <sup>12</sup>What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.”</p>
	<p><sup>13</sup>His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.”</p>
	<p><sup>14</sup>So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. <sup>15</sup>Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. <sup>16</sup>She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. <sup>17</sup>Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</p>
	<p><sup>18</sup>He went to his father and said, “My father.”</p>
	<p>“Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”</p>
	<p><sup>19</sup>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”</p>
	<p><sup>20</sup>Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?”</p>
	<p>“The LORD your God gave me success,” he replied.</p>
	<p><sup>21</sup>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”</p>
	<p><sup>22</sup>Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <sup>23</sup>He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. <sup>24</sup>“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked.</p>
	<p>“I am,” he replied.</p>
	<p><sup>25</sup>Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.”</p>
	<p>Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. <sup>26</sup>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”</p>
	<p><sup>27</sup>So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p>“Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. <sup>28</sup>May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine. <sup>29</sup>May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><sup>30</sup>After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. <sup>31</sup>He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”</p>
	<p><sup>32</sup>His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?”</p>
	<p>“I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.”</p>
	<p><sup>33</sup>Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!”</p>
	<p><sup>34</sup>When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!”</p>
	<p><sup>35</sup>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”</p>
	<p><sup>36</sup>Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob<a id="filepos457024" href="009.html#filepos681561"><sup>[119]</sup></a>? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?”</p>
	<p><sup>37</sup>Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”</p>
	<p><sup>38</sup>Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.</p>
	<p><sup>39</sup>His father Isaac answered him,</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p>“Your dwelling will be away from the earth’s richness, away from the dew of heaven above. <sup>40</sup>You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><sup>41</sup>Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”</p>
	<p><sup>42</sup>When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. <sup>43</sup>Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. <sup>44</sup>Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides. <sup>45</sup>When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”</p>
	<p><sup>46</sup>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”</p>

<section id="filepos460672">
	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos27073">Genesis 28</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman. <sup>2</sup>Go at once to Paddan Aram,<a id="filepos461067" href="009.html#filepos682022"><sup>[120]</sup></a> to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel.

	<p id="filepos461924"><sup>6</sup>Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” <sup id="filepos462197">7</sup>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. <sup>8</sup>Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; <sup>9</sup>so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.</p>

		<h4>Jacob’s Dream at Bethel</h4>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. <sup>11</sup>When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. <sup id="filepos463008">12</sup>He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. <sup>13</sup>There above it<a id="filepos463204" href="009.html#filepos682714"><sup>[122]</sup></a> stood the LORD, and he said: “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. <sup>14</sup>Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.<a id="filepos463756" href="009.html#filepos682967"><sup>[123]</sup></a> <sup>15</sup>I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” <sup>17</sup>He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. <sup>19</sup>He called that place Bethel,<a id="filepos464719" href="009.html#filepos683331"><sup>[124]</sup></a> though the city used to be called Luz.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear <sup>21</sup>so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the LORD<a id="filepos465236" href="009.html#filepos683598"><sup>[125]</sup></a> will be my God <sup>22</sup>and<a id="filepos465355" href="009.html#filepos683927"><sup>[126]</sup></a> this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”</p>

		<h4>Jacob Arrives in Paddan Aram</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples. <sup>2</sup>There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large. <sup>3</sup>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?”</p>
		<p>“We’re from Harran,” they replied.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, we know him,” they answered.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd. <sup>10</sup>When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep. <sup>11</sup>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. <sup>12</sup>He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things. <sup>14</sup>Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.”</p>

		<h4>Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel</h4>
		<p>After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month, <sup>15</sup>Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. <sup>17</sup>Leah had weak<a id="filepos469817" href="009.html#filepos684379"><sup>[127]</sup></a> eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful. <sup>18</sup>Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.” <sup>20</sup>So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.”</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. <sup>23</sup>But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her. <sup>24</sup>And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. <sup>27</sup>Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. <sup>29</sup>Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant. <sup>30</sup>Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.</p>

		<h4>Jacob’s Children</h4>
		<p><sup>31</sup>When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless. <sup>32</sup>Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben,<a id="filepos472630" href="009.html#filepos684624"><sup>[128]</sup></a> for she said, “It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.”</p>
