	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos161318">Jeremiah 1</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. <sup>2</sup>The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, <sup>3</sup>and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.</p>

		<h4>The Call of Jeremiah</h4>
		<p><sup>4</sup>The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>5</sup>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew<a id="filepos7080193" href="059.html#filepos7734985"><sup>[1]</sup></a> you, before you were born I set you apart;</p>
			<p>I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>6</sup>“Alas, Sovereign LORD,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>But the LORD said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. <sup>8</sup>Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I have put my words in your mouth. <sup>10</sup>See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?”</p>
		<p>“I see the branch of an almond tree,” I replied.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>The LORD said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching<a id="filepos7082331" href="059.html#filepos7735223"><sup>[2]</sup></a> to see that my word is fulfilled.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>The word of the LORD came to me again: “What do you see?”</p>
		<p>“I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. <sup>15</sup>I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>17</sup>“Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. <sup>18</sup>Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. <sup>19</sup>They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD.</p>

		<h4>Israel Forsakes God</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:</p>
		<p>“This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,’ ” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Hear the word of the LORD, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>5</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me?</p>
			<p>They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>They did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce.</p>
			<p>But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>The priests did not ask,</p>
			<p>‘Where is the LORD?’</p>
			<p>Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me.</p>
			<p>The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“Therefore I bring charges against you again,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p>“And I will bring charges against your children’s children.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar<a id="filepos7092537" href="059.html#filepos7735642"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Has a nation ever changed its gods?</p>
			<p>(Yet they are not gods at all.)</p>
			<p>But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“My people have committed two sins:</p>
			<p>They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth?</p>
			<p>Why then has he become plunder?</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Lions have roared; they have growled at him.</p>
			<p>They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the LORD your God when he led you in the way?</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile<a id="filepos7097025" href="059.html#filepos7735892"><sup>[4]</sup></a>?</p>
			<p>And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates?</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you.</p>
			<p>Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me,” declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>“Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, ‘I will not serve you!’</p>
			<p>Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock.</p>
			<p>How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Although you wash yourself with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me,” declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;</p>
			<p>I have not run after the Baals’?</p>
			<p>See how you behaved in the valley; consider what you have done.</p>
			<p>You are a swift she-camel running here and there,</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving—in her heat who can restrain her?</p>
			<p>Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry.</p>
			<p>But you said, ‘It’s no use!</p>
			<p>I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.’</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the people of Israel are disgraced—</p>
			<p>they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’</p>
			<p>They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say,</p>
			<p>‘Come and save us!’</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Where then are the gods you made for yourselves?</p>
			<p>Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble!</p>
			<p>For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>“Why do you bring charges against me?</p>
			<p>You have all rebelled against me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>“In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction.</p>
			<p>Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>31</sup>“You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness?</p>
			<p>Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will come to you no more’?</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments?</p>
			<p>Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.</p>
			<p><sup>33</sup>How skilled you are at pursuing love!</p>
			<p>Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.</p>
			<p><sup>34</sup>On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in.</p>
			<p>Yet in spite of all this</p>
			<p><sup>35</sup>you say, ‘I am innocent; he is not angry with me.’</p>
			<p>But I will pass judgment on you because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</p>
			<p><sup>36</sup>Why do you go about so much, changing your ways?</p>
			<p>You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.</p>
			<p><sup>37</sup>You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them.</p>

		<h4>Unfaithful Israel</h4>
		<p><sup>6</sup>During the reign of King Josiah, the LORD said to me, “Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there. <sup>7</sup>I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. <sup>8</sup>I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. <sup>9</sup>Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. <sup>10</sup>In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah. <sup>12</sup>Go, proclaim this message toward the north:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>‘I will frown on you no longer, for I am faithful,’ declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>‘I will not be angry forever.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Only acknowledge your guilt—you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,’ ” declares the LORD.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“Return, faithless people,” declares the LORD, “for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion. <sup>15</sup>Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. <sup>16</sup>In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the LORD, “people will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made. <sup>17</sup>At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. <sup>18</sup>In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>“I myself said,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’</p>
			<p>I thought you would call me ‘Father’ and not turn away from following me.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the LORD their God.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>“Return, faithless people;</p>
			<p>I will cure you of backsliding.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we will come to you, for you are the LORD our God.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors’ labor—their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us.</p>
			<p>We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our ancestors; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the LORD our God.”</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>5</sup>“Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say:</p>
			<p>‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’</p>
			<p>Cry aloud and say:</p>
			<p>‘Gather together!</p>
			<p>Let us flee to the fortified cities!’</p>

			<p>Flee for safety without delay!</p>

			<p><sup>7</sup>A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out.</p>
			<p>He has left his place to lay waste your land.</p>
			<p>Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>So put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>“In that day,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“the king and the officials will lose heart, the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at our throats!”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse; <sup>12</sup>a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.”</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">

			<p><sup>14</sup>Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved.</p>
			<p>How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>A voice is announcing from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>“Tell this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem:</p>
			<p>‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land, raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against me,’ ” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>“Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you.</p>
			<p>This is your punishment.</p>
			<p>How bitter it is!</p>
			<p>How it pierces to the heart!”</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Oh, my anguish, my anguish!</p>
			<p>I writhe in pain.</p>
			<p>Oh, the agony of my heart!</p>
			<p>My heart pounds within me,</p>
			<p>I cannot keep silent.</p>
			<p>For I have heard the sound of the trumpet;</p>
			<p>I have heard the battle cry.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins.</p>
			<p>In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>“My people are fools; they do not know me.</p>
			<p>They are senseless children; they have no understanding.</p>
			<p>They are skilled in doing evil; they know not how to do good.”</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>27</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“The whole land will be ruined, though I will not destroy it completely.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark, because I have spoken and will not relent,</p>
			<p>I have decided and will not turn back.”</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight.</p>
			<p>Some go into the thickets; some climb up among the rocks.</p>
			<p>All the towns are deserted; no one lives in them.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>What are you doing, you devastated one?</p>
			<p>Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold?</p>
			<p>Why highlight your eyes with makeup?</p>
			<p>You adorn yourself in vain.</p>
			<p>Your lovers despise you; they want to kill you.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a groan as of one bearing her first child—the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying,</p>
			<p>“Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers.”</p>

			<p><sup>1</sup>“Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares.</p>
			<p>If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth,</p>
			<p>I will forgive this city.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>Although they say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’ still they are swearing falsely.”</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>LORD, do not your eyes look for truth?</p>
			<p>You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction.</p>
			<p>They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>I thought, “These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God.”</p>

			<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out, for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“Why should I forgive you?</p>
			<p>Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods.</p>

		<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Because the people have spoken these words,</p>
			<p>I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>People of Israel,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“I am bringing a distant nation against you—an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand.</p>

	<section>
		<h4>False Religion Worthless</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup>2</sup>“Stand at the gate of the LORD’s house and there proclaim this message:</p>
		<p>“ ‘Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the LORD. <sup>3</sup>This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place. <sup>4</sup>Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD!” <sup>5</sup>If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly, <sup>6</sup>if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, <sup>7</sup>then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever. <sup>8</sup>But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>“ ‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury,<a id="filepos7191849" href="059.html#filepos7736654"><sup>[6]</sup></a> burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known, <sup>10</sup>and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things? <sup id="filepos7192162">11</sup>Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>“ ‘Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. <sup>13</sup>While you were doing all these things, declares the LORD, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer. <sup>14</sup>Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors. <sup>15</sup>I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.’</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>“So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. <sup>17</sup>Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? <sup>18</sup>The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger. <sup>19</sup>But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place—on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the crops of your land—and it will burn and not be quenched.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>“ ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! <sup>22</sup>For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, <sup>23</sup>but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you. <sup>24</sup>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. <sup>25</sup>From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. <sup>26</sup>But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.’</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>“When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. <sup>28</sup>Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>“ ‘Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath.</p>
		<h4>The Valley of Slaughter</h4>
		<p><sup>30</sup>“ ‘The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it. <sup>31</sup>They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind. <sup>32</sup>So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. <sup>33</sup>Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. <sup>34</sup>I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.</p>

	<p><sup>1</sup>“ ‘At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves. <sup>2</sup>They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped.

		<h4>Sin and Punishment</h4>
		<p><sup>4</sup>“Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘When people fall down, do they not get up?</p>
			<p>When someone turns away, do they not return?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Why then have these people turned away?</p>
			<p>Why does Jerusalem always turn away?</p>
			<p>They cling to deceit; they refuse to return.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right.</p>
			<p>None of them repent of their wickedness,</p>
			<p>saying, “What have I done?”</p>
			<p>Each pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration.</p>
			<p>But my people do not know the requirements of the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>“ ‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,” when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped.</p>
			<p>Since they have rejected the word of the LORD, what kind of wisdom do they have?</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners.</p>
			<p>From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious.</p>
			<p>“Peace, peace,” they say, when there is no peace.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct?</p>
			<p>No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.</p>
			<p>So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“ ‘I will take away their harvest, declares the LORD.</p>
			<p>There will be no grapes on the vine.</p>
			<p>There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither.</p>
			<p>What I have given them will be taken from them.<a id="filepos7206838" href="059.html#filepos7737028"><sup>[7]</sup></a>’ ”</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Why are we sitting here?</p>
			<p>Gather together!</p>
			<p>Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there!</p>
			<p>For the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>The snorting of the enemy’s horses is heard from Dan; at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles.</p>
			<p>They have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>“See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>You who are my Comforter<a id="filepos7210721" href="059.html#filepos7737309"><sup>[8]</sup></a> in sorrow, my heart is faint within me.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away:</p>
			<p>“Is the LORD not in Zion?</p>
			<p>Is her King no longer there?”</p>
			<p>“Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?”</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>“The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.”</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Since my people are crushed, I am crushed;</p>
			<p>I mourn, and horror grips me.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Is there no balm in Gilead?</p>
			<p>Is there no physician there?</p>
			<p>Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?</p>

	<p><sup>12</sup>Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?</p>
	<p><sup>13</sup>The LORD said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law. <sup>14</sup>Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.” <sup>15</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water. <sup>16</sup>I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.”</p>
