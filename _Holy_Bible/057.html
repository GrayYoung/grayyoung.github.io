<h3><a href="004.html#filepos163129">Jeremiah 11</a></h3>
<div>
<h4>The Covenant Is Broken</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup>2</sup>“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>3</sup>Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant— <sup>4</sup>the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. <sup>5</sup>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”</p>
<p>I answered, “Amen, LORD.”</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. <sup>7</sup>From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” <sup>8</sup>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. <sup>11</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. <sup>12</sup>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. <sup>13</sup>You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><sup>15</sup>“What is my beloved doing in my temple</span></p></blockquote><p><span>as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Can consecrated meat avert your punishment?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>When you engage in your wickedness,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>then you rejoice.<a id="filepos7250813" href="059.html#filepos7739678"><sup>[15]</sup></a>”</p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p><sup>16</sup>The LORD called you a thriving olive tree</span></p></blockquote><p><span>with fruit beautiful in form.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>But with the roar of a mighty storm</span></p></blockquote><p><span>he will set it on fire,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and its branches will be broken.</p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p><sup>17</sup>The LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.</p>
<h4>Plot Against Jeremiah</h4>
<p><sup>18</sup>Because the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. <sup>19</sup>I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying,</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>let us cut him off from the land of the living,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>that his name be remembered no more.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>20</sup>But you, LORD Almighty, who judge righteously</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and test the heart and mind,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>let me see your vengeance on them,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>for to you I have committed my cause.</p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p><sup>21</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands”— <sup>22</sup>therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. <sup>23</sup>Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”</p>

<h4>A Linen Belt</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.” <sup>2</sup>So I bought a belt, as the LORD directed, and put it around my waist.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time: <sup>4</sup>“Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath<a id="filepos7267161" href="059.html#filepos7740727"><sup>[18]</sup></a> and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.” <sup id="filepos7267300">5</sup>So I went and hid it at Perath, as the LORD told me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Many days later the LORD said to me, “Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.” <sup>7</sup>So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>9</sup>“This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless! <sup>11</sup>For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the LORD, ‘to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.’</p>
<h4>Wineskins</h4>
<p><sup>12</sup>“Say to them: ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’ <sup>13</sup>then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the LORD.

<div>
<h4>Day of Disaster</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>2</sup>“You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” <sup>3</sup>For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: <sup>4</sup>“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For this is what the LORD says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the LORD. <sup>6</sup>“Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. <sup>7</sup>No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. <sup>9</sup>For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?’ <sup>11</sup>then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. <sup>12</sup>But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. <sup>13</sup>So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>“However, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ <sup>15</sup>but it will be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the LORD, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. <sup>17</sup>My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. <sup>18</sup>I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”</p>

They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. <sup>26</sup>People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD. <sup>27</sup>But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.’ ”</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup>2</sup>“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” <sup>3</sup>So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. <sup>4</sup>But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me. <sup>6</sup>He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. <sup>7</sup>If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, <sup>8</sup>and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. <sup>9</sup>And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, <sup>10</sup>and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.</p>

There proclaim the words I tell you, <sup>3</sup>and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen!

They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon. <sup>6</sup>And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’ ”</p>

<p><span>God Rejects Zedekiah’s Request</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said: <sup>2</sup>“Inquire now of the LORD for us because Nebuchadnezzar<a id="filepos7355382" href="059.html#filepos7744878"><sup>[29]</sup></a> king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, <sup>4</sup>‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians<a id="filepos7356046" href="059.html#filepos7745216"><sup>[30]</sup></a> who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. <sup>5</sup>I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. <sup>6</sup>I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. <sup>7</sup>After that, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the LORD says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. <sup id="filepos7357133">9</sup>Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. <sup>10</sup>I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the LORD. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the LORD. <sup>12</sup>This is what the LORD says to you, house of David:</p>

<h4>Judgment Against Wicked Kings</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>This is what the LORD says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there: <sup>2</sup>‘Hear the word of the LORD to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David’s throne—you, your officials and your people who come through these gates. <sup>3</sup>This is what the LORD says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. <sup>4</sup>For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. <sup>5</sup>But if you do not obey these commands, declares the LORD, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.’ ”</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. <sup>2</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the LORD. <sup>3</sup>“I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. <sup>4</sup>I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD.</p>

<h4>Lying Prophets</h4>
<p><sup>9</sup>Concerning the prophets:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>My heart is broken within me;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>all my bones tremble.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I am like a drunken man,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>like a strong man overcome by wine,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>because of the LORD</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and his holy words.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>10</sup>The land is full of adulterers;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>because of the curse<a id="filepos7381332" href="059.html#filepos7747205"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the land lies parched</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and the pastures in the wilderness are withered.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The prophets follow an evil course</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and use their power unjustly.</p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p><sup>11</sup>“Both prophet and priest are godless;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>even in my temple I find their wickedness,”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>declares the LORD.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><sup>12</sup>“Therefore their path will become slippery;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>they will be banished to darkness</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and there they will fall.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I will bring disaster on them</span></p></blockquote><p><span>in the year they are punished,”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>declares the LORD.</p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p><sup>13</sup>“Among the prophets of Samaria</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I saw this repulsive thing:</span></p></blockquote><p><span>They prophesied by Baal</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and led my people Israel astray.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>14</sup>And among the prophets of Jerusalem</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I have seen something horrible:</span></p></blockquote><p><span>They commit adultery and live a lie.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>They strengthen the hands of evildoers,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>so that not one of them turns from their wickedness.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>They are all like Sodom to me;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”</p></blockquote>

<p><sup>16</sup>This is what the LORD Almighty says:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>“Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>they fill you with false hopes.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>They speak visions from their own minds,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>not from the mouth of the LORD.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>17</sup>They keep saying to those who despise me,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>‘The LORD says: You will have peace.’</span></p></blockquote><p><span>And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts</span></p></blockquote><p><span>they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>18</sup>But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD</span></p></blockquote><p><span>to see or to hear his word?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Who has listened and heard his word?</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>19</sup>See, the storm of the LORD</span></p></blockquote><p><span>will burst out in wrath,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>a whirlwind swirling down</span></p></blockquote><p><span>on the heads of the wicked.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>20</sup>The anger of the LORD will not turn back</span></p></blockquote><p><span>until he fully accomplishes</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the purposes of his heart.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In days to come</span></p></blockquote><p><span>you will understand it clearly.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>21</sup>I did not send these prophets,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>yet they have run with their message;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I did not speak to them,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>yet they have prophesied.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>22</sup>But if they had stood in my council,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>they would have proclaimed my words to my people</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and would have turned them from their evil ways</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and from their evil deeds.</p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p><sup>23</sup>“Am I only a God nearby,”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>declares the LORD,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“and not a God far away?</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>24</sup>Who can hide in secret places</span></p></blockquote><p><span>so that I cannot see them?”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>declares the LORD.</p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p>“Do not I fill heaven and earth?”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>declares the LORD.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><sup>25</sup>“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ <sup>26</sup>How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? <sup>27</sup>They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. <sup>28</sup>Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. <sup>29</sup>“Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>“Therefore,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. <sup>31</sup>Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The LORD declares.’ <sup>32</sup>Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the LORD. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the LORD.</p>
<h4>False Prophecy</h4>
<p><sup>33</sup>“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the LORD?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.’ <sup>34</sup>If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ I will punish them and their household. <sup>35</sup>This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ <sup>36</sup>But you must not mention ‘a message from the LORD’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. <sup>37</sup>This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the LORD’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ <sup>38</sup>Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ this is what the LORD says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD.’ <sup>39</sup>Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. <sup>40</sup>I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”</p>
