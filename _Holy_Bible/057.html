<div>
<p><span><span>The Covenant Is Broken</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the <span>LORD</span>: <sup>2</sup>“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>3</sup>Tell them that this is what the <span>LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant— <sup>4</sup>the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. <sup>5</sup>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”</span></p>
<p><span>I answered, “Amen, <span>LORD</span>.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. <sup>7</sup>From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” <sup>8</sup>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. <sup>11</sup>Therefore this is what the <span>LORD</span> says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. <sup>12</sup>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. <sup>13</sup>You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span><sup>15</sup>“What is my beloved doing in my temple</span></p></blockquote><p><span>as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Can consecrated meat avert your punishment?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>When you engage in your wickedness,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>then you rejoice.<a id="filepos7250813" href="059.html#filepos7739678"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a>”</span></p></blockquote>
<br/><blockquote><p><span><sup>16</sup>The <span>LORD</span> called you a thriving olive tree</span></p></blockquote><p><span>with fruit beautiful in form.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>But with the roar of a mighty storm</span></p></blockquote><p><span>he will set it on fire,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and its branches will be broken.</span></p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>The <span>LORD</span> Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Plot Against Jeremiah</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>Because the <span>LORD</span> revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. <sup>19</sup>I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying,</span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span>“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>let us cut him off from the land of the living,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>that his name be remembered no more.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>20</sup>But you, <span>LORD</span> Almighty, who judge righteously</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and test the heart and mind,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>let me see your vengeance on them,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>for to you I have committed my cause.</span></p></blockquote>
<br/></div>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>Therefore this is what the <span>LORD</span> says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the <span>LORD</span> or you will die by our hands”— <sup>22</sup>therefore this is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. <sup>23</sup>Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>A Linen Belt</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> said to me: “Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.” <sup>2</sup>So I bought a belt, as the <span>LORD</span> directed, and put it around my waist.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Day of Disaster</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the word of the <span>LORD</span> came to me: <sup>2</sup>“You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” <sup>3</sup>For this is what the <span>LORD</span> says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: <sup>4</sup>“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>For this is what the <span>LORD</span> says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>6</sup>“Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. <sup>7</sup>No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. <sup>9</sup>For this is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the <span>LORD</span> decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the <span>LORD</span> our God?’ <sup>11</sup>then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the <span>LORD</span>, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. <sup>12</sup>But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. <sup>13</sup>So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>“However, the days are coming,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the <span>LORD</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ <sup>15</sup>but it will be said, ‘As surely as the <span>LORD</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. <sup>17</sup>My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. <sup>18</sup>I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”</span></p>

<p id="filepos7340479"><span><sup>1</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests <sup>2</sup>and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you, <sup>3</sup>and say, ‘Hear the word of the <span>LORD</span>, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. <sup>4</sup>For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. <sup>5</sup>They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. <sup>6</sup>So beware, the days are coming, declares the <span>LORD</span>, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“ ‘In this place I will ruin<a id="filepos7341984" href="059.html#filepos7743734"><span><sup>[26]</sup></span></a> the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals. <sup>8</sup>I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. <sup>9</sup>I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.’</span></p>
<p id="filepos7342678"><span><sup>10</sup>“Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, <sup>11</sup>and say to them, ‘This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. <sup>12</sup>This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the <span>LORD</span>. I will make this city like Topheth. <sup>13</sup>The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the <span>LORD</span> had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the <span>LORD</span>’s temple and said to all the people, <sup>15</sup>“This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen!

<p><span><span>God Rejects Zedekiah’s Request</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The word came to Jeremiah from the <span>LORD</span> when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said: <sup>2</sup>“Inquire now of the <span>LORD</span> for us because Nebuchadnezzar<a id="filepos7355382" href="059.html#filepos7744878"><span><sup>[29]</sup></span></a> king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the <span>LORD</span> will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, <sup>4</sup>‘This is what the <span>LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians<a id="filepos7356046" href="059.html#filepos7745216"><span><sup>[30]</sup></span></a> who are outside the wall besieging you.

He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the <span>LORD</span> says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. <sup id="filepos7357133">9</sup>Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague.

<p><span><sup>16</sup>This is what the <span>LORD</span> Almighty says:</span></p>

<p><span><sup>25</sup>“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ <sup>26</sup>How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? <sup>27</sup>They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. <sup>28</sup>Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>29</sup>“Is not my word like fire,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>“Therefore,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. <sup>31</sup>Yes,” declares the <span>LORD</span>, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The <span>LORD</span> declares.’ <sup>32</sup>Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the <span>LORD</span>. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the <span>LORD</span>.</span></p>

<p><span><sup>33</sup>“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the <span>LORD</span>?’ say to them, ‘What message?

So you distort the words of the living God, the <span>LORD</span> Almighty, our God. <sup>37</sup>This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the <span>LORD</span>’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the <span>LORD</span> spoken?’ <sup>38</sup>Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the <span>LORD</span>,’ this is what the <span>LORD</span> says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the <span>LORD</span>,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the <span>LORD</span>.’ <sup>39</sup>Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. <sup>40</sup>I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”</span></p>
