		<h4>God and Idols</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Hear what the LORD says to you, people of Israel. <sup>2</sup>This is what the LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>For the practices of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk.</p>
			<p>Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.”</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>No one is like you, LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.</p>
			<p id="filepos7234053"><sup>7</sup>Who should not fear you,</p>
			<p>King of the nations?</p>
			<p>This is your due.</p>
			<p>Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz.</p>
			<p>What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple—all made by skilled workers.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King.</p>
			<p>When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>“Tell them this: ‘These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.’ ”<a id="filepos7237131" href="059.html#filepos7739296"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>12</sup>But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth.</p>
			<p>He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols.</p>
			<p>The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the people of his inheritance—the LORD Almighty is his name.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4>Coming Destruction</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>17</sup>Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>For this is what the LORD says:</p>
			<p>“At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land;</p>
			<p>I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.”</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Woe to me because of my injury!</p>
			<p>My wound is incurable!</p>
			<p>Yet I said to myself,</p>
			<p>“This is my sickness, and I must endure it.”</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped.</p>
			<p>My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Listen! The report is coming—a great commotion from the land of the north!</p>
			<p>It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Jeremiah’s Prayer</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>23</sup>LORD, I know that people’s lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Discipline me, LORD, but only in due measure—not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name.</p>
			<p>For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.</p>

		<h4>The Covenant Is Broken</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup>2</sup>“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>3</sup>Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant—<sup>4</sup>the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. <sup>5</sup>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”</p>
		<p>I answered, “Amen, LORD.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. <sup>7</sup>From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” <sup>8</sup>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. <sup>11</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. <sup>12</sup>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. <sup>13</sup>You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>15</sup>“What is my beloved doing in my temple as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes?</p>
			<p>Can consecrated meat avert your punishment?</p>
			<p>When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice.<a id="filepos7250813" href="059.html#filepos7739678"><sup>[15]</sup></a>”</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>The LORD called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form.</p>
			<p>But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire, and its branches will be broken.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.</p>

		<h4>Plot Against Jeremiah</h4>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Because the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. <sup>19</sup>I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying,</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more.”</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>But you, LORD Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands”—<sup>22</sup>therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. <sup>23</sup>Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”</p>

		<h4>Jeremiah’s Complaint</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>You are always righteous, LORD, when I bring a case before you.</p>
			<p>Yet I would speak with you about your justice:</p>
			<p>Why does the way of the wicked prosper?</p>
			<p>Why do all the faithless live at ease?</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit.</p>
			<p>You are always on their lips but far from their hearts.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Yet you know me, LORD; you see me and test my thoughts about you.</p>
			<p>Drag them off like sheep to be butchered!</p>
			<p>Set them apart for the day of slaughter!</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered?</p>
			<p>Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the people are saying,</p>
			<p>“He will not see what happens to us.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>God’s Answer</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>5</sup>“If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses?</p>
			<p>If you stumble<a id="filepos7259013" href="059.html#filepos7740103"><sup>[16]</sup></a> in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by<a id="filepos7259281" href="059.html#filepos7740358"><sup>[17]</sup></a> the Jordan?</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Your relatives, members of your own family—even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you.</p>
			<p>Do not trust them, though they speak well of you.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance;</p>
			<p>I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest.</p>
			<p>She roars at me; therefore I hate her.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack?</p>
			<p>Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing.</p>
			<p>They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the LORD’s fierce anger.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>14</sup>This is what the LORD says: “As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them. <sup>15</sup>But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country. <sup>16</sup>And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the LORD lives’—even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among my people. <sup>17</sup>But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,” declares the LORD.</p>

		<h4>A Linen Belt</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.” <sup>2</sup>So I bought a belt, as the LORD directed, and put it around my waist.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time: <sup>4</sup>“Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath<a id="filepos7267161" href="059.html#filepos7740727"><sup>[18]</sup></a> and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.” <sup id="filepos7267300">5</sup>So I went and hid it at Perath, as the LORD told me.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Many days later the LORD said to me, “Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.” <sup>7</sup>So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>9</sup>“This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless! <sup>11</sup>For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the LORD, ‘to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.’</p>

		<h4>Wineskins</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>“Say to them: ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’ <sup>13</sup>then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the LORD. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.’ ”</p>

		<h4>Threat of Captivity</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>15</sup>Hear and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills.</p>
			<p>You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>If you do not listen,</p>
			<p>I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the LORD’s flock will be taken captive.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>Say to the king and to the queen mother,</p>
			<p>“Come down from your thrones, for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads.”</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>The cities in the Negev will be shut up, and there will be no one to open them.</p>
			<p>All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Look up and see those who are coming from the north.</p>
			<p>Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted?</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>What will you say when the LORD sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies?</p>
			<p>Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor?</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>And if you ask yourself,</p>
			<p>“Why has this happened to me?”—it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Can an Ethiopian<a id="filepos7276128" href="059.html#filepos7741071"><sup>[19]</sup></a> change his skin or a leopard its spots?</p>
			<p>Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>“I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind.</p>

			<p>“because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>I will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen—</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution!</p>
			<p>I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields.</p>

		<h4>Drought, Famine, Sword</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>“Judah mourns, her cities languish; they wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water.</p>
			<p>They return with their jars unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they cover their heads.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of food.”</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Although our sins testify against us, do something, LORD, for the sake of your name.</p>
			<p>For we have often rebelled; we have sinned against you.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>You who are the hope of Israel, its Savior in times of distress, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays only a night?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a warrior powerless to save?</p>
			<p>You are among us, LORD, and we bear your name; do not forsake us!</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>10</sup>This is what the LORD says about this people:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“They greatly love to wander; they do not restrain their feet.</p>
			<p>So the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Then the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people. <sup>12</sup>Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>But I said, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! The prophets keep telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Then the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries<a id="filepos7287552" href="059.html#filepos7741484"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and the delusions of their own minds. <sup>15</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine. <sup>16</sup>And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>“Speak this word to them:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing; for the Virgin Daughter, my people, has suffered a grievous wound, a crushing blow.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>If I go into the country,</p>
			<p>I see those slain by the sword; if I go into the city,</p>
			<p>I see the ravages of famine.</p>
			<p>Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not.’ ”</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>Have you rejected Judah completely?</p>
			<p>Do you despise Zion?</p>
			<p>Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed?</p>
			<p>We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>We acknowledge our wickedness, LORD, and the guilt of our ancestors; we have indeed sinned against you.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>For the sake of your name do not despise us; do not dishonor your glorious throne.</p>
			<p>Remember your covenant with us and do not break it.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?</p>
			<p>Do the skies themselves send down showers?</p>
			<p>No, it is you, LORD our God.</p>

They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. <sup>7</sup>No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. <sup>9</sup>For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?’ <sup>11</sup>then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. <sup>12</sup>But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. <sup>13</sup>So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“However, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ <sup>15</sup>but it will be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the LORD, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. <sup>17</sup>My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. <sup>18</sup>I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>19</sup>LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in time of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say,</p>

		<h4>At the Potter’s House</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup>2</sup>“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” <sup>3</sup>So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. <sup>4</sup>But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>Then the word of the LORD came to me. <sup>6</sup>He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. <sup>7</sup>If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, <sup>8</sup>and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. <sup>9</sup>And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, <sup>10</sup>and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you.

There proclaim the words I tell you, <sup>3</sup>and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. <sup>4</sup>For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. <sup>5</sup>They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. <sup>6</sup>So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.</p>
	<p><sup>7</sup>“ ‘In this place I will ruin<a id="filepos7341984" href="059.html#filepos7743734"><sup>[26]</sup></a> the plans of Judah and Jerusalem.

	<p id="filepos7342678"><sup>10</sup>“Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, <sup>11</sup>and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired.

	<p><sup>14</sup>Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the LORD’s temple and said to all the people, <sup>15</sup>“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen!

			<p>“Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.”</p>

		<h4>The Righteous Branch</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. <sup>2</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the LORD. <sup>3</sup>“I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. <sup>4</sup>I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>5</sup>“The days are coming,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“when I will raise up for David<a id="filepos7377976" href="059.html#filepos7746944"><sup>[35]</sup></a> a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety.</p>
			<p>This is the name by which he will be called:</p>
			<p>The LORD Our Righteous Savior.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>7</sup>“So then, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when people will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ <sup>8</sup>but they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”</p>

		<h4>Lying Prophets</h4>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Concerning the prophets:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble.</p>
			<p>I am like a drunken man, like a strong man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and his holy words.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse<a id="filepos7381332" href="059.html#filepos7747205"><sup>[36]</sup></a> the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered.</p>
			<p>The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>“Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall.</p>
			<p>I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished,” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>“Among the prophets of Samaria</p>
			<p>I saw this repulsive thing:</p>
			<p>They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>And among the prophets of Jerusalem</p>
			<p>I have seen something horrible:</p>
			<p>They commit adultery and live a lie.</p>
			<p>They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that not one of them turns from their wickedness.</p>
			<p>They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets:</p>
		<div title="poetry">
			<p>“I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”</p>
		</div>
		<p><sup>16</sup>This is what the LORD Almighty says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes.</p>
			<p>They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>They keep saying to those who despise me,</p>
			<p>‘The LORD says: You will have peace.’</p>
			<p>And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word?</p>
			<p>Who has listened and heard his word?</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart.</p>
			<p>In days to come you will understand it clearly.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message;</p>
			<p>I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>“Am I only a God nearby,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“and not a God far away?</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?” declares the LORD.</p>
			<p>“Do not I fill heaven and earth?” declares the LORD.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>25</sup>“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ <sup>26</sup>How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? <sup>27</sup>They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. <sup>28</sup>Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. <sup>29</sup>“Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>“Therefore,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. <sup>31</sup>Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The LORD declares.’ <sup>32</sup>Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the LORD. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the LORD.</p>

		<h4>False Prophecy</h4>
		<p><sup>33</sup>“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the LORD?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.’ <sup>34</sup>If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ I will punish them and their household. <sup>35</sup>This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ <sup>36</sup>But you must not mention ‘a message from the LORD’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. <sup>37</sup>This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the LORD’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ <sup>38</sup>Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ this is what the LORD says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD.’ <sup>39</sup>Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. <sup>40</sup>I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”</p>
