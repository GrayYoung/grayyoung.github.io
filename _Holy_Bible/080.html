<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled<a id="filepos9634803" href="081.html#filepos9932075"><sup>[1]</sup></a> among us, <sup>2</sup>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. <sup>3</sup>With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup>4</sup>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</p>
<h4>The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</h4>
<p><sup>5</sup>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. <sup>6</sup>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. <sup>7</sup>But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, <sup>9</sup>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <sup>10</sup>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. <sup>12</sup>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. <sup>13</sup>But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. <sup>14</sup>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, <sup>15</sup>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. <sup>16</sup>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. <sup>17</sup>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. <sup>20</sup>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. <sup>22</sup>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>When his time of service was completed, he returned home. <sup>24</sup>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. <sup>25</sup>“The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”</p>
<h4>The Birth of Jesus Foretold</h4>
<p><sup>26</sup>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, <sup>27</sup>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. <sup>28</sup>The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. <sup>30</sup>But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. <sup>31</sup>You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. <sup>32</sup>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <sup>33</sup>and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>“How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called<a id="filepos9640636" href="081.html#filepos9932328"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the Son of God. <sup>36</sup>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. <sup>37</sup>For no word from God will ever fail.”</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.</p>
<h4>Mary Visits Elizabeth</h4>
<p><sup>39</sup>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, <sup>40</sup>where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. <sup>41</sup>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <sup>42</sup>In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! <sup>43</sup>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <sup>44</sup>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. <sup>45</sup>Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”</p>
<p><span>Mary’s Song</span></p>
<p><sup>46</sup>And Mary said:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>“My soul glorifies the Lord</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>47</sup>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>48</sup>for he has been mindful</span></p></blockquote><p><span>of the humble state of his servant.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>From now on all generations will call me blessed,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>49</sup>for the Mighty One has done great things for me—</span></p></blockquote><p><span>holy is his name.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>50</sup>His mercy extends to those who fear him,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>from generation to generation.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>51</sup>He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>52</sup>He has brought down rulers from their thrones</span></p></blockquote><p><span>but has lifted up the humble.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>53</sup>He has filled the hungry with good things</span></p></blockquote><p><span>but has sent the rich away empty.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>54</sup>He has helped his servant Israel,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>remembering to be merciful</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>55</sup>to Abraham and his descendants forever,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>just as he promised our ancestors.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>56</sup>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</p>
<h4>The Birth of John the Baptist</h4>
<p><sup>57</sup>When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. <sup>58</sup>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, <sup>60</sup>but his mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.”</p>
<p><sup>61</sup>They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”</p>
<p><sup>62</sup>Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. <sup>63</sup>He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.” <sup>64</sup>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. <sup>65</sup>All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. <sup>66</sup>Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.</p>
<p><span>Zechariah’s Song</span></p>
<p><sup>67</sup>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><sup>68</sup>“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>because he has come to his people and redeemed them.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>69</sup>He has raised up a horn<a id="filepos9648468" href="081.html#filepos9932606"><sup>[3]</sup></a> of salvation for us</span></p></blockquote><p><span>in the house of his servant David</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>70</sup>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>71</sup>salvation from our enemies</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and from the hand of all who hate us—</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>72</sup>to show mercy to our ancestors</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and to remember his holy covenant,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>73</sup>the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>74</sup>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and to enable us to serve him without fear</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>75</sup>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</p></blockquote>
<br/><br/><blockquote><p><sup>76</sup>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>77</sup>to give his people the knowledge of salvation</span></p></blockquote><p><span>through the forgiveness of their sins,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>78</sup>because of the tender mercy of our God,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>79</sup>to shine on those living in darkness</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and in the shadow of death,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>to guide our feet into the path of peace.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>80</sup>And the child grew and became strong in spirit<a id="filepos9652202" href="081.html#filepos9932872"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.</p>

<div>
<h4>The Birth of Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. <sup>2</sup>(This was the first census that took place while<a id="filepos9652944" href="081.html#filepos9933233"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Quirinius was governor of Syria.) <sup>3</sup>And everyone went to their own town to register.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. <sup>5</sup>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. <sup>6</sup>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, <sup>7</sup>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. <sup>9</sup>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. <sup>10</sup>But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. <sup>11</sup>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. <sup>12</sup>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><sup>14</sup>“Glory to God in the highest heaven,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>15</sup>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. <sup>17</sup>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, <sup>18</sup>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. <sup>19</sup>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. <sup>20</sup>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.</p>
<h4>Jesus Presented in the Temple</h4>
<p><sup>22</sup>When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord <sup>23</sup>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”<a id="filepos9656737" href="081.html#filepos9933495"><sup>[6]</sup></a>), <sup>24</sup>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”<a id="filepos9656967" href="081.html#filepos9933840"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. <sup>26</sup>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. <sup>27</sup>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, <sup>28</sup>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><sup>29</sup>“Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>you may now dismiss<a id="filepos9658027" href="081.html#filepos9934126"><sup>[8]</sup></a> your servant in peace.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>30</sup>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>31</sup>which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>32</sup>a light for revelation to the Gentiles,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>and the glory of your people Israel.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>33</sup>The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. <sup>34</sup>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, <sup>35</sup>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.”</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, <sup>37</sup>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four.<a id="filepos9659729" href="081.html#filepos9934383"><sup>[9]</sup></a> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. <sup>38</sup>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. <sup>40</sup>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.</p>
<h4>The Boy Jesus at the Temple</h4>
<p><sup>41</sup>Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. <sup>42</sup>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. <sup>43</sup>After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. <sup>44</sup>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. <sup>45</sup>When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. <sup>46</sup>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. <sup>47</sup>Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup>48</sup>When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”</p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>49</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why were you searching for me?”</span></span> he asked. <span><span>“Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”</span></span><a id="filepos9661998" href="081.html#filepos9934661"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<sup>50</sup>But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</span></p>
<p><sup>51</sup>Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. <sup>52</sup>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</p>

<h4>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— <sup>2</sup>during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. <sup>3</sup>He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <sup>4</sup>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p>“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>‘Prepare the way for the Lord,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>make straight paths for him.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>5</sup>Every valley shall be filled in,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>every mountain and hill made low.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The crooked roads shall become straight,</span></p></blockquote><p><span>the rough ways smooth.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><sup>6</sup>And all people will see God’s salvation.’ ”<a id="filepos9664832" href="081.html#filepos9935045"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? <sup>8</sup>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. <sup>9</sup>The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>“What should we do then?” the crowd asked.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>“Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”</p>
<p>He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. <sup>16</sup>John answered them all, “I baptize you with<a id="filepos9667073" href="081.html#filepos9935341"><sup>[12]</sup></a> water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with<a id="filepos9667292" href="081.html#filepos9935578"><sup>[13]</sup></a> the Holy Spirit and fire. <sup>17</sup>His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” <sup>18</sup>And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, <sup>20</sup>Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</p>
<h4>The Baptism and Genealogy of Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>21</sup>When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened <sup>22</sup>and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph,</p>

<h4>Jesus Is Tested in the Wilderness</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, <sup>2</sup>where for forty days he was tempted<a id="filepos9675749" href="081.html#filepos9936513"><sup>[16]</sup></a> by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Jesus answered, <span><span>“It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’</span></span><a id="filepos9676365" href="081.html#filepos9936794"><sup>[17]</sup></a><span><span>”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. <sup>6</sup>And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. <sup>7</sup>If you worship me, it will all be yours.”</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Jesus answered, <span><span>“It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’</span></span><a id="filepos9677166" href="081.html#filepos9937080"><sup>[18]</sup></a><span><span>”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. <sup>10</sup>For it is written:</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</p>
<h4>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</h4>
<p><sup>14</sup>Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. <sup>15</sup>He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, <sup>17</sup>and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>because he has anointed me</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>to proclaim good news</span></span><span><span> to the poor.</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>and recovery of sight for the blind,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>to set the oppressed free,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”</span></span><a id="filepos9681439" href="081.html#filepos9938001"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><sup>20</sup>Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. <sup>21</sup>He began by saying to them, <span><span>“Today this scripture is fulfilled</span></span><span><span> in your hearing.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>22</sup>All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Jesus said to them, <span><span>“Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown</span></span><span><span> what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’ ”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>“Truly I tell you,”</span></span> he continued, <span><span>“no prophet is accepted in his hometown.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>And there were many in Israel with leprosy</span></span><a id="filepos9683569" href="081.html#filepos9938429"><sup>[22]</sup></a><span><span> in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup>All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. <sup>29</sup>They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. <sup>30</sup>But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</p>
<h4>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</h4>
<p><sup>31</sup>Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. <sup>32</sup>They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, <sup>34</sup>“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>“Be quiet!”</span></span> Jesus said sternly. <span><span>“Come out of him!”</span></span> Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” <sup>37</sup>And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</p>
<h4>Jesus Heals Many</h4>
<p><sup>38</sup>Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. <sup>39</sup>So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. <sup>41</sup>Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.</p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. <sup>43</sup>But he said, <span><span>“I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God</span></span><span><span> to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”</span></span>
<sup>44</sup>And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</span></p>

<h4>Jesus Calls His First Disciples</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,<a id="filepos9687753" href="081.html#filepos9938872"><sup>[23]</sup></a> the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. <sup>2</sup>He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. <sup>3</sup>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span><span>“Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. <sup>7</sup>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” <sup>9</sup>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, <sup>10</sup>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.</p>
<p><span>Then Jesus said to Simon, <span><span>“Don’t be afraid;</span></span><span><span> from now on you will fish for people.”</span></span>
<sup>11</sup>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</span></p>
<h4>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</h4>
<p><sup>12</sup>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.<a id="filepos9690205" href="081.html#filepos9939123"><sup>[24]</sup></a> When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <span><span>“I am willing,”</span></span> he said. <span><span>“Be clean!”</span></span> And immediately the leprosy left him.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Then Jesus ordered him, <span><span>“Don’t tell anyone,</span></span><span><span> but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded</span></span><span><span> for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. <sup>16</sup>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</p>
<h4>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</h4>
<p><sup>17</sup>One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. <sup>18</sup>Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. <sup>19</sup>When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, <span><span>“Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, <span><span>“Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>But I want you to know that the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> has authority on earth to forgive sins.”</span></span> So he said to the paralyzed man, <span><span>“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”</span></span>
<sup>25</sup>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. <sup>26</sup>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”</span></p>
<h4>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners</h4>
<p><sup>27</sup>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. <span><span>“Follow me,”</span></span> Jesus said to him, <sup>28</sup>and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. <sup>30</sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</p>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>Jesus answered them, <span><span>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h4>
<p><sup>33</sup>They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”</p>
<p><span><sup>34</sup>Jesus answered, <span><span>“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom</span></span><span><span> fast while he is with them?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them;</span></span><span><span> in those days they will fast.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>36</sup>He told them this parable: <span><span>“No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>37</sup></span></span><span><span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>38</sup></span></span><span><span>No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>39</sup></span></span><span><span>And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’ ”</span></span></span></p>

<h4>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. <sup>2</sup>Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”</p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>Jesus answered them, <span><span>“Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat.</span></span><span><span> And he also gave some to his companions.”</span></span>
<sup>5</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span><span>“The Son of Man</span></span><span><span> is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>6</sup>On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. <sup>7</sup>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. <sup>8</sup>But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, <span><span>“Get up and stand in front of everyone.”</span></span> So he got up and stood there.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span><span>“I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, <span><span>“Stretch out your hand.”</span></span> He did so, and his hand was completely restored. <sup>11</sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</p>
<h4>The Twelve Apostles</h4>
<p><sup>12</sup>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. <sup>13</sup>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: <sup>14</sup>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, <sup>15</sup>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, <sup>16</sup>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</p>
<h4>Blessings and Woes</h4>
<p><sup>17</sup>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, <sup>18</sup>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, <sup>19</sup>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Looking at his disciples, he said:</p>
<br/><div title="poetry">

<br/><p><span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy,</span></span><span><span> because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.</span></span></p>

<h4>Love for Enemies</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>Do to others as you would have them do to you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?</span></span><span><span> Even sinners love those who love them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you?</span></span><span><span> Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>But love your enemies, do good to them,</span></span><span><span> and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children</span></span><span><span> of the Most High,</span></span><span><span> because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>Be merciful,</span></span><span><span> just as your Father</span></span><span><span> is merciful.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Judging Others</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>37</sup></span></span><span><span>“Do not judge, and you will not be judged.</span></span><span><span> Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>38</sup></span></span><span><span>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.</span></span><span><span> For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>39</sup>He also told them this parable: <span><span>“Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>40</sup></span></span><span><span>The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>A Tree and Its Fruit</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>43</sup></span></span><span><span>“No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.</span></span><span><span> People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>45</sup></span></span><span><span>A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Wise and Foolish Builders</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’</span></span><span><span> and do not do what I say?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>47</sup></span></span><span><span>As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice,</span></span><span><span> I will show you what they are like.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>48</sup></span></span><span><span>They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>49</sup></span></span><span><span>But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”</span></span></span></p>

<h4>The Faith of the Centurion</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. <sup>2</sup>There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup>3</sup>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. <sup>4</sup>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, <sup>5</sup>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” <sup>6</sup>So Jesus went with them.</p>
<p>He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup>7</sup>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup>8</sup>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, <span><span>“I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.”</span></span>
<sup>10</sup>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</span></p>
<p><span>Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</span></p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup>12</sup>As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup>13</sup>When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, <span><span>“Don’t cry.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span><span>“Young man, I say to you, get up!”</span></span>
<sup>15</sup>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup>They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” <sup>17</sup>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</p>
<h4>Jesus and John the Baptist</h4>
<p><sup>18</sup>John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup>19</sup>he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ”</p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup>22</sup>So he replied to the messengers, <span><span>“Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy</span></span><a id="filepos9717117" href="081.html#filepos9939566"><sup>[25]</sup></a><span><span> are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: <span><span>“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>But what did you go out to see? A prophet?</span></span><span><span> Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>This is the one about whom it is written:</span></span></span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span>“ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>who will prepare your way before you.’</span></span><a id="filepos9718842" href="081.html#filepos9939895"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p><sup>29</sup>(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup>30</sup>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)</p>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>Jesus went on to say, <span><span>“To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</span></span>

<h4>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</h4>
<p><sup>36</sup>When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. <sup>37</sup>A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. <sup>38</sup>As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Jesus answered him, <span><span>“Simon, I have something to tell you.”</span></span></p>
<p>“Tell me, teacher,” he said.</p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,</span></span><a id="filepos9723405" href="081.html#filepos9940181"><sup>[27]</sup></a><span><span> and the other fifty.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”</p>
<p><span><span>“You have judged correctly,”</span></span> Jesus said.</p>
<p><span><sup>44</sup>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, <span><span>“Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet,</span></span><span><span> but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>45</sup></span></span><span><span>You did not give me a kiss,</span></span><span><span> but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>You did not put oil on my head,</span></span><span><span> but she has poured perfume on my feet.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>47</sup></span></span><span><span>Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>48</sup>Then Jesus said to her, <span><span>“Your sins are forgiven.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup>The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”</p>
<p><sup>50</sup>Jesus said to the woman, <span><span>“Your faith has saved you;</span></span><span><span> go in peace.”</span></span></p>

<h4>The Parable of the Sower</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup>2</sup>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup>3</sup>Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”</span></span></span></p>
<p>When he said this, he called out, <span><span>“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup>His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup>10</sup>He said, <span><span>“The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you,</span></span><span><span> but to others I speak in parables, so that,</span></span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span>“ ‘though seeing, they may not see;</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>though hearing, they may not understand.’</span></span><a id="filepos9728884" href="081.html#filepos9940643"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>“This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches</span></span><span><span> and pleasures, and they do not mature.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span><span>But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>A Lamp on a Stand</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>“No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Jesus’ Mother and Brothers</span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup>20</sup>Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He replied, <span><span>“My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”</span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Calms the Storm</h4>
<p><sup>22</sup>One day Jesus said to his disciples, <span><span>“Let us go over to the other side of the lake.”</span></span> So they got into a boat and set out. <sup>23</sup>As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!”</p>
<p>He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. <span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>“Where is your faith?”</span></span> he asked his disciples.</p>
<p>In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”</p>
<p><span>Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man</span></p>
<p><sup>26</sup>They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,<a id="filepos9733651" href="081.html#filepos9940931"><sup>[29]</sup></a> which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup>27</sup>When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup>28</sup>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” <sup>29</sup>For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Jesus asked him, <span><span>“What is your name?”</span></span></p>
<p>“Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. <sup>31</sup>And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. <sup>33</sup>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup>35</sup>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup>36</sup>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup id="filepos9735819">37</sup>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <span><span><sup>39</sup></span></span><span><span>“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.”</span></span> So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</p>
<h4>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</h4>
<p><sup>40</sup>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup>41</sup>Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup>42</sup>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.</p>
<p>As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. <sup>43</sup>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,<a id="filepos9737220" href="081.html#filepos9941297"><sup>[30]</sup></a> but no one could heal her. <sup>44</sup>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</p>
<p><span><span><sup>45</sup></span></span><span><span>“Who touched me?”</span></span> Jesus asked.</p>
<p>When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>But Jesus said, <span><span>“Someone touched me;</span></span><span><span> I know that power has gone out from me.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>47</sup>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup>48</sup>Then he said to her, <span><span>“Daughter, your faith has healed you.</span></span><span><span> Go in peace.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”</p>
<p><sup>50</sup>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, <span><span>“Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>51</sup>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother. <sup>52</sup>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. <span><span>“Stop wailing,”</span></span> Jesus said. <span><span>“She is not dead but asleep.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>53</sup>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup>54</sup>But he took her by the hand and said, <span><span>“My child, get up!”</span></span>
<sup>55</sup>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup>56</sup>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</span></p>

<div>
<h4>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve</h4>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, <sup>2</sup>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. <sup>3</sup>He told them: <span><span>“Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</span></span>
<sup>6</sup>So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, <sup>8</sup>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. <sup>9</sup>But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him.</p>
<h4>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h4>
<p><sup>10</sup>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, <sup>11</sup>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He replied, <span><span>“You give them something to eat.”</span></span></p>
<p>They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.” <sup>14</sup>(About five thousand men were there.)</p>
<p><span>But he said to his disciples, <span><span>“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</span></span>
<sup>15</sup>The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. <sup>16</sup>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. <sup>17</sup>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</span></p>
<h4>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</h4>
<p><sup>18</sup>Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, <span><span>“Who do the crowds say I am?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>“But what about you?”</span></span> he asked. <span><span>“Who do you say I am?”</span></span></p>
<p>Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”</p>
<h4>Jesus Predicts His Death</h4>
<p><sup>21</sup>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. <sup>22</sup>And he said, <span><span>“The Son of Man</span></span><span><span> must suffer many things</span></span><span><span> and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law,</span></span><span><span> and he must be killed</span></span><span><span> and on the third day</span></span><span><span> be raised to life.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>Then he said to them all: <span><span>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them</span></span><span><span> when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”</span></span></p>
<h4>The Transfiguration</h4>
<p><sup>28</sup>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. <sup>29</sup>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. <sup>30</sup>Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. <sup>31</sup>They spoke about his departure,<a id="filepos9747755" href="081.html#filepos9941707"><sup>[31]</sup></a> which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. <sup>32</sup>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. <sup>33</sup>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. <sup id="filepos9748495">35</sup>A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.” <sup>36</sup>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</p>
<p><span>Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</span></p>
<p><sup>37</sup>The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. <sup>38</sup>A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. <sup>39</sup>A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. <sup>40</sup>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>“You unbelieving and perverse generation,”</span></span> Jesus replied, <span><span>“how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>42</sup>Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. <sup>43</sup>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.</p>
<h4>Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time</h4>
<p><span>While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, <span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>“Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”</span></span>
<sup>45</sup>But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span></p>
<p><sup>46</sup>An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. <sup>47</sup>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. <sup>48</sup>Then he said to them, <span><span>“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.</span></span><span><span> For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup>“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>50</sup></span></span><span><span>“Do not stop him,”</span></span> Jesus said, <span><span>“for whoever is not against you is for you.”</span></span></p>
<h4>Samaritan Opposition</h4>
<p><sup>51</sup>As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. <sup>52</sup>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; <sup>53</sup>but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. <sup>54</sup>When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them<a id="filepos9752765" href="081.html#filepos9941951"><sup>[32]</sup></a>?” <sup>55</sup>But Jesus turned and rebuked them. <sup>56</sup>Then he and his disciples went to another village.</p>
<h4>The Cost of Following Jesus</h4>
<p><sup>57</sup>As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”</p>
<p><sup>58</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> has no place to lay his head.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>59</sup>He said to another man, <span><span>“Follow me.”</span></span></p>
<p>But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</p>
<p><sup>60</sup>Jesus said to him, <span><span>“Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>61</sup>Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.”</p>
<p><sup>62</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>“All things have been committed to me by my Father.</span></span><span><span> No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, <span><span>“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Good Samaritan</h4>
<p><sup>25</sup>On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>“What is written in the Law?”</span></span> he replied. <span><span>“How do you read it?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>27</sup>He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’<a id="filepos9762404" href="081.html#filepos9942922"><sup>[35]</sup></a>; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’<a id="filepos9762542" href="081.html#filepos9943210"><sup>[36]</sup></a>”</p>
<p><span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>“You have answered correctly,”</span></span> Jesus replied. <span><span>“Do this and you will live.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>29</sup>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>In reply Jesus said: <span><span>“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>But a Samaritan,</span></span><span><span> as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>The next day he took out two denarii</span></span><a id="filepos9764490" href="081.html#filepos9943499"><sup>[37]</sup></a><span><span> and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>37</sup>The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”</p>
<p>Jesus told him, <span><span>“Go and do likewise.”</span></span></p>
<h4>At the Home of Martha and Mary</h4>
<p><sup>38</sup>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. <sup>39</sup>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. <sup>40</sup>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”</p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>“Martha, Martha,”</span></span> the Lord answered, <span><span>“you are worried</span></span><span><span> and upset about many things,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>but few things are needed—or indeed only one.</span></span><a id="filepos9766665" href="081.html#filepos9943848"><sup>[38]</sup></a><span><span> Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Jesus’ Teaching on Prayer</span></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“When you pray, say:</span></span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span><span>“ ‘Father,</span></span><a id="filepos9767874" href="081.html#filepos9944241"><sup>[39]</sup></a></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>hallowed be your name,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>your kingdom</span></span><span><span> come.</span></span><a id="filepos9768374" href="081.html#filepos9944510"><sup>[40]</sup></a></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>Give us each day our daily bread.</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>Forgive us our sins,</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.</span></span><a id="filepos9769189" href="081.html#filepos9944815"><sup>[41]</sup></a></span></p></blockquote><p><span><span><span>And lead us not into temptation.</span></span><a id="filepos9769474" href="081.html#filepos9945083"><sup>[42]</sup></a><span><span>’ ”</span></span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><sup>5</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span><span>“Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;</span></span>
<span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity</span></span><a id="filepos9770604" href="081.html#filepos9945376"><sup>[43]</sup></a><span><span> he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;</span></span><span><span> seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for</span></span><a id="filepos9771582" href="081.html#filepos9945640"><sup>[44]</sup></a><span><span> a fish, will give him a snake instead?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus and Beelzebul</h4>
<p><sup>14</sup>Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. <sup>15</sup>But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.” <sup>16</sup>Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: <span><span>“Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>If Satan</span></span><span><span> is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>But if I drive out demons by the finger of God,</span></span><span><span> then the kingdom of God</span></span><span><span> has come upon you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>“Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>27</sup>As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.”</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>He replied, <span><span>“Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God</span></span><span><span> and obey it.”</span></span></p>
<h4>The Sign of Jonah</h4>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>As the crowds increased, Jesus said, <span><span>“This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign,</span></span><span><span> but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom;</span></span><span><span> and now something greater than Solomon is here.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah;</span></span><span><span> and now something greater than Jonah is here.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Lamp of the Body</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>“No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy,</span></span><a id="filepos9777801" href="081.html#filepos9945948"><sup>[45]</sup></a><span><span> your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy,</span></span><a id="filepos9777995" href="081.html#filepos9946232"><sup>[46]</sup></a><span><span> your body also is full of darkness.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Woes on the Pharisees and the Experts in the Law</h4>
<p><sup>37</sup>When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. <sup>38</sup>But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.</p>
<p><span><sup>39</sup>Then the Lord said to him, <span><span>“Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>40</sup></span></span><span><span>You foolish people!</span></span><span><span> Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>41</sup></span></span><span><span>But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor,</span></span><span><span> and everything will be clean for you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>42</sup></span></span><span><span>“Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth</span></span><span><span> of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God.</span></span><span><span> You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>43</sup></span></span><span><span>“Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>“Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves,</span></span><span><span> which people walk over without knowing it.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>45</sup>One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.”</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>47</sup></span></span><span><span>“Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>48</sup></span></span><span><span>So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>49</sup></span></span><span><span>Because of this, God in his wisdom</span></span><span><span> said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>50</sup></span></span><span><span>Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>51</sup></span></span><span><span>from the blood of Abel</span></span><span><span> to the blood of Zechariah,</span></span><span><span> who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>52</sup></span></span><span><span>“Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>53</sup>When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, <sup>54</sup>waiting to catch him in something he might say.</p>

<h4>Warnings and Encouragements</h4>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: <span><span>“Be</span></span><a id="filepos9784185" href="081.html#filepos9946631"><sup>[47]</sup></a><span><span> on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span><span>There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>“I tell you, my friends,</span></span><span><span> do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span></span><span><span> Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>“I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned</span></span><span><span> before the angels of God.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man</span></span><span><span> will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>“When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Rich Fool</h4>
<p><sup>13</sup>Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”</p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Jesus replied, <span><span>“Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?”</span></span>
<sup>15</sup>Then he said to them, <span><span>“Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>And he told them this parable: <span><span>“The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.” ’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>“But God said to him, ‘You fool!</span></span><span><span> This very night your life will be demanded from you.</span></span><span><span> Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>“This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.”</span></span></p>
<h4>Do Not Worry</h4>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples: <span><span>“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them.</span></span><span><span> And how much more valuable you are than birds!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life</span></span><a id="filepos9790666" href="081.html#filepos9946921"><sup>[48]</sup></a><span><span>?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>“Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor</span></span><span><span> was dressed like one of these.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father</span></span><span><span> knows that you need them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>But seek his kingdom,</span></span><span><span> and these things will be given to you as well.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>“Do not be afraid,</span></span><span><span> little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>Sell your possessions and give to the poor.</span></span><span><span> Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven</span></span><span><span> that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Watchfulness</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>“Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>36</sup></span></span><span><span>like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>37</sup></span></span><span><span>It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes.</span></span><span><span> Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>38</sup></span></span><span><span>It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>39</sup></span></span><span><span>But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief</span></span><span><span> was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>40</sup></span></span><span><span>You also must be ready,</span></span><span><span> because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>41</sup>Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”</p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>The Lord answered, <span><span>“Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>43</sup></span></span><span><span>It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>44</sup></span></span><span><span>Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>45</sup></span></span><span><span>But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>46</sup></span></span><span><span>The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.</span></span><span><span> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>47</sup></span></span><span><span>“The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>48</sup></span></span><span><span>But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows.</span></span><span><span> From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Not Peace but Division</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>49</sup></span></span><span><span>“I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>50</sup></span></span><span><span>But I have a baptism</span></span><span><span> to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>51</sup></span></span><span><span>Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>52</sup></span></span><span><span>From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>53</sup></span></span><span><span>They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Interpreting the Times</h4>
<p><span><sup>54</sup>He said to the crowd: <span><span>“When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>55</sup></span></span><span><span>And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>56</sup></span></span><span><span>Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>57</sup></span></span><span><span>“Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>58</sup></span></span><span><span>As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>59</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.”</span></span></span></p>

<h4>Repent or Perish</h4>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <sup>2</sup>Jesus answered, <span><span>“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam</span></span><span><span> fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, no! But unless you repent,</span></span><span><span> you too will all perish.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>Then he told this parable: <span><span>“A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down!</span></span><span><span> Why should it use up the soil?’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath</h4>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, <sup>11</sup>and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. <sup>12</sup>When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, <span><span>“Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.”</span></span>
<sup>13</sup>Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”</p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>The Lord answered him, <span><span>“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham,</span></span><span><span> whom Satan</span></span><span><span> has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><sup>17</sup>When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</p>
<h4>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</h4>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>Then Jesus asked, <span><span>“What is the kingdom of God</span></span><span><span> like?</span></span><span><span> What shall I compare it to?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree,</span></span><span><span> and the birds perched in its branches.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Again he asked, <span><span>“What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds</span></span><a id="filepos9805349" href="081.html#filepos9947299"><sup>[49]</sup></a><span><span> of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Narrow Door</h4>
<p><sup>22</sup>Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. <sup>23</sup>Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?”</p>
<p><span>He said to them, <span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door,</span></span><span><span> because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“But he will answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>“But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>“There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth,</span></span><span><span> when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>People will come from east and west</span></span><span><span> and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Jesus’ Sorrow for Jerusalem</span></p>
<p><sup>31</sup>At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”</p>
<p><span><sup>32</sup>He replied, <span><span>“Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet</span></span><span><span> can die outside Jerusalem!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,</span></span><span><span> and you were not willing.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>Look, your house is left to you desolate.</span></span><span><span> I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’</span></span><a id="filepos9809921" href="081.html#filepos9947546"><sup>[50]</sup></a><span><span>”</span></span></span></p>

<h3><a href="004.html#filepos208122">Luke 14</a></h3>
<div>
<p><span>Jesus at a Pharisee’s House</span></p>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. <sup>2</sup>There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. <sup>3</sup>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, <span><span>“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</span></span>
<sup>4</sup>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>Then he asked them, <span><span>“If one of you has a child</span></span><a id="filepos9811156" href="081.html#filepos9947952"><sup>[51]</sup></a><span><span> or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?”</span></span>
<sup>6</sup>And they had nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: <span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>“When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Then Jesus said to his host, <span><span>“When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Great Banquet</h4>
<p><sup>15</sup>When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>Jesus replied: <span><span>“A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>“But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>“Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>“Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>“The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Cost of Being a Disciple</h4>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: <span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>33</sup></span></span><span><span>In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>34</sup></span></span><span><span>“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>35</sup></span></span><span><span>It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”</span></span></p>

<h4>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. <sup>2</sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”</p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>Then Jesus told them this parable: <span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</span></span>
<span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Lost Coin</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins</span></span><a id="filepos9821462" href="081.html#filepos9948322"><sup>[52]</sup></a><span><span> and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Parable of the Lost Son</h4>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Jesus continued: <span><span>“There was a man who had two sons.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’</span></span><span><span> So he divided his property</span></span><span><span> between them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth</span></span><span><span> in wild living.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span><span>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span><span>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</span></span>
<span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned</span></span><span><span> against heaven and against you.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span><span>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’</span></span>
<span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span><span>So he got up and went to his father.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>21</sup></span></span><span><span>“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span></span><span><span> I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span><span>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe</span></span><span><span> and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger</span></span><span><span> and sandals on his feet.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>23</sup></span></span><span><span>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span><span>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again;</span></span><span><span> he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>25</sup></span></span><span><span>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span><span>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>27</sup></span></span><span><span>‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>28</sup></span></span><span><span>“The older brother became angry</span></span><span><span> and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span><span>But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span><span>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property</span></span><span><span> with prostitutes</span></span><span><span> comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>32</sup></span></span><span><span>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”</span></span></span></p>

<h4>The Parable of the Shrewd Manager</h4>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Jesus told his disciples: <span><span>“There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span><span>So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span><span>“The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—</span></span>
<span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span><span>I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span><span>“So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span><span>“ ‘Nine hundred gallons</span></span><a id="filepos9830263" href="081.html#filepos9948725"><sup>[53]</sup></a><span><span> of olive oil,’ he replied.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>7</sup></span></span><span><span>“Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“ ‘A thousand bushels</span></span><a id="filepos9831107" href="081.html#filepos9948971"><sup>[54]</sup></a><span><span> of wheat,’ he replied.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>8</sup></span></span><span><span>“The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world</span></span><span><span> are more shrewd</span></span><span><span> in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span><span>I tell you, use worldly wealth</span></span><span><span> to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span><span>“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,</span></span><span><span> and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span><span>So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth,</span></span><span><span> who will trust you with true riches?</span></span>
<span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span><span>And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span><span>“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”</span></span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. <sup>15</sup>He said to them, <span><span>“You are the ones who justify yourselves</span></span><span><span> in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts.</span></span><span><span> What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.</span></span></p>
<h4>Additional Teachings</h4>
<p><span><span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span><span>“The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John.</span></span><span><span> Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached,</span></span><span><span> and everyone is forcing their way into it.</span></span>
<span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span><span>It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span><span>“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span></span></p>
