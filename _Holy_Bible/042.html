		<p id="filepos4955384"><sup>1</sup>We praise you, God,</p>
		<p>we praise you, for your Name is near;</p>
		<p>people tell of your wonderful deeds.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>You say, “I choose the appointed time;</p>
		<p>it is I who judge with equity.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>When the earth and all its people quake,</p>

		<p id="filepos4957141"><sup>5</sup>Do not lift your horns against heaven;</p>
		<p>do not speak so defiantly.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>No one from the east or the west</p>
		<p>or from the desert can exalt themselves.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>It is God who judges:</p>
		<p>He brings one down, he exalts another.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>In the hand of the LORD is a cup</p>
		<p>full of foaming wine mixed with spices;</p>
		<p>he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth</p>
		<p>drink it down to its very dregs.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>As for me, I will declare this forever;</p>
		<p>I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,</p>
		<p id="filepos4959265"><sup>10</sup>who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked,</p>
		<p>but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”</p>

		<p id="filepos4965479"><sup>1</sup>I cried out to God for help;</p>
		<p>I cried out to God to hear me.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;</p>
		<p>at night I stretched out untiring hands,</p>
		<p>and I would not be comforted.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>I remembered you, God, and I groaned;</p>

		<p>My heart meditated and my spirit asked:</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>“Will the Lord reject forever?</p>
		<p>Will he never show his favor again?</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Has his unfailing love vanished forever?</p>
		<p>Has his promise failed for all time?</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>My people, hear my teaching;</p>
		<p>listen to the words of my mouth.</p>
		<p id="filepos4974184"><sup>2</sup>I will open my mouth with a parable;</p>
		<p>I will utter hidden things, things from of old—</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>things we have heard and known,</p>
		<p>things our ancestors have told us.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>We will not hide them from their descendants;</p>
		<p>we will tell the next generation</p>
		<p>the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD,</p>
		<p>his power, and the wonders he has done.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>He decreed statutes for Jacob</p>
		<p>and established the law in Israel,</p>
		<p>which he commanded our ancestors</p>
		<p>to teach their children,</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>so the next generation would know them,</p>
		<p>even the children yet to be born,</p>
		<p>and they in turn would tell their children.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Then they would put their trust in God</p>
		<p>and would not forget his deeds</p>
		<p>but would keep his commands.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>They would not be like their ancestors—</p>
		<p>a stubborn and rebellious generation,</p>
		<p>whose hearts were not loyal to God,</p>
		<p>whose spirits were not faithful to him.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,</p>
		<p>turned back on the day of battle;</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>they did not keep God’s covenant</p>
		<p>and refused to live by his law.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>They forgot what he had done,</p>
		<p>the wonders he had shown them.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors</p>
		<p>in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>He divided the sea and led them through;</p>
		<p>he made the water stand up like a wall.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>He guided them with the cloud by day</p>
		<p>and with light from the fire all night.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>He split the rocks in the wilderness</p>
		<p>and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>he brought streams out of a rocky crag</p>
		<p>and made water flow down like rivers.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>But they continued to sin against him,</p>
		<p>rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>They willfully put God to the test</p>
		<p>by demanding the food they craved.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>They spoke against God;</p>
		<p>they said, “Can God really</p>
		<p>spread a table in the wilderness?</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>True, he struck the rock,</p>
		<p>and water gushed out,</p>
		<p>streams flowed abundantly,</p>
		<p>but can he also give us bread?</p>
		<p>Can he supply meat for his people?”</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>When the LORD heard them, he was furious;</p>
		<p>his fire broke out against Jacob,</p>
		<p>and his wrath rose against Israel,</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>for they did not believe in God</p>
		<p>or trust in his deliverance.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Yet he gave a command to the skies above</p>
		<p>and opened the doors of the heavens;</p>
		<p id="filepos4984050"><sup>24</sup>he rained down manna for the people to eat,</p>
		<p>he gave them the grain of heaven.</p>
		<p id="filepos4984404"><sup>25</sup>Human beings ate the bread of angels;</p>
		<p>he sent them all the food they could eat.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>He let loose the east wind from the heavens</p>
		<p>and by his power made the south wind blow.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>He rained meat down on them like dust,</p>
		<p>birds like sand on the seashore.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>He made them come down inside their camp,</p>
		<p>all around their tents.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>They ate till they were gorged—</p>
		<p>he had given them what they craved.</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>But before they turned from what they craved,</p>
		<p>even while the food was still in their mouths,</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>God’s anger rose against them;</p>
		<p>he put to death the sturdiest among them,</p>
		<p>cutting down the young men of Israel.</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;</p>
		<p>in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</p>
		<p><sup>33</sup>So he ended their days in futility</p>
		<p>and their years in terror.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him;</p>
		<p>they eagerly turned to him again.</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>They remembered that God was their Rock,</p>
		<p>that God Most High was their Redeemer.</p>
		<p><sup>36</sup>But then they would flatter him with their mouths,</p>
		<p>lying to him with their tongues;</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>their hearts were not loyal to him,</p>
		<p>they were not faithful to his covenant.</p>
		<p><sup>38</sup>Yet he was merciful;</p>
		<p>he forgave their iniquities</p>
		<p>and did not destroy them.</p>
		<p>Time after time he restrained his anger</p>
		<p>and did not stir up his full wrath.</p>
		<p><sup>39</sup>He remembered that they were but flesh,</p>
		<p>a passing breeze that does not return.</p>
		<p><sup>40</sup>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness</p>
		<p>and grieved him in the wasteland!</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>Again and again they put God to the test;</p>
		<p>they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>They did not remember his power—</p>
		<p>the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>the day he displayed his signs in Egypt,</p>
		<p>his wonders in the region of Zoan.</p>
		<p><sup>44</sup>He turned their river into blood;</p>
		<p>they could not drink from their streams.</p>
		<p><sup>45</sup>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them,</p>
		<p>and frogs that devastated them.</p>
		<p><sup>46</sup>He gave their crops to the grasshopper,</p>
		<p>their produce to the locust.</p>
		<p><sup>47</sup>He destroyed their vines with hail</p>
		<p>and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</p>
		<p><sup>48</sup>He gave over their cattle to the hail,</p>
		<p>their livestock to bolts of lightning.</p>
		<p><sup>49</sup>He unleashed against them his hot anger,</p>
		<p>his wrath, indignation and hostility—</p>
		<p>a band of destroying angels.</p>
		<p><sup>50</sup>He prepared a path for his anger;</p>
		<p>he did not spare them from death</p>
		<p>but gave them over to the plague.</p>
		<p><sup>51</sup>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,</p>
		<p>the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</p>
		<p><sup>52</sup>But he brought his people out like a flock;</p>
		<p>he led them like sheep through the wilderness.</p>
		<p><sup>53</sup>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid;</p>
		<p>but the sea engulfed their enemies.</p>
		<p><sup>54</sup>And so he brought them to the border of his holy land,</p>
		<p>to the hill country his right hand had taken.</p>
		<p><sup>55</sup>He drove out nations before them</p>
		<p>and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance;</p>
		<p>he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</p>
		<p><sup>56</sup>But they put God to the test</p>
		<p>and rebelled against the Most High;</p>
		<p>they did not keep his statutes.</p>
		<p><sup>57</sup>Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless,</p>
		<p>as unreliable as a faulty bow.</p>
		<p><sup>58</sup>They angered him with their high places;</p>
		<p>they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</p>
		<p><sup>59</sup>When God heard them, he was furious;</p>
		<p>he rejected Israel completely.</p>
		<p><sup>60</sup>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,</p>
		<p>the tent he had set up among humans.</p>
		<p><sup>61</sup>He sent the ark of his might into captivity,</p>
		<p>his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</p>
		<p><sup>62</sup>He gave his people over to the sword;</p>
		<p>he was furious with his inheritance.</p>
		<p><sup>63</sup>Fire consumed their young men,</p>
		<p>and their young women had no wedding songs;</p>
		<p><sup>64</sup>their priests were put to the sword,</p>
		<p>and their widows could not weep.</p>
		<p><sup>65</sup>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,</p>
		<p>as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.</p>
		<p><sup>66</sup>He beat back his enemies;</p>
		<p>he put them to everlasting shame.</p>
		<p><sup>67</sup>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph,</p>
		<p>he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</p>
		<p><sup>68</sup>but he chose the tribe of Judah,</p>
		<p>Mount Zion, which he loved.</p>
		<p><sup>69</sup>He built his sanctuary like the heights,</p>
		<p>like the earth that he established forever.</p>
		<p><sup>70</sup>He chose David his servant</p>
		<p>and took him from the sheep pens;</p>
		<p><sup>71</sup>from tending the sheep he brought him</p>
		<p>to be the shepherd of his people Jacob,</p>
		<p>of Israel his inheritance.</p>
		<p><sup>72</sup>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart;</p>
		<p>with skillful hands he led them.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;</p>
		<p>they have defiled your holy temple,</p>
		<p>they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>They have left the dead bodies of your servants</p>

		<p><sup>11</sup>May the groans of the prisoners come before you;</p>

	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>Lord, you have been our dwelling place</p>
		<p>throughout all generations.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Before the mountains were born</p>
		<p>or you brought forth the whole world,</p>
		<p>from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</p>

		<p><sup>5</sup>Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death—</p>
		<p>they are like the new grass of the morning:</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>In the morning it springs up new,</p>
		<p>but by evening it is dry and withered.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>We are consumed by your anger</p>
		<p>and terrified by your indignation.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>You have set our iniquities before you,</p>
		<p>our secret sins in the light of your presence.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>All our days pass away under your wrath;</p>
		<p>we finish our years with a moan.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Our days may come to seventy years,</p>
		<p>or eighty, if our strength endures;</p>
		<p>yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow,</p>
		<p>for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>If only we knew the power of your anger!</p>
		<p>Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Teach us to number our days,</p>
		<p>that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Relent, LORD! How long will it be?</p>
		<p>Have compassion on your servants.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love,</p>
		<p>that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,</p>
		<p>for as many years as we have seen trouble.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>May your deeds be shown to your servants,</p>
		<p>your splendor to their children.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>May the favor<a id="filepos5095132" href="045.html#filepos5608977"><sup>[240]</sup></a> of the Lord our God rest on us;</p>
