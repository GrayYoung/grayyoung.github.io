	<h3><a href="004.html#filepos149256">Isaiah 1</a></h3>
	<p><sup>1</sup>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
	<section>
		<h4>A Rebellious Nation</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!</p>
			<p>For the LORD has spoken:</p>
			<p>“I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.”</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption!</p>
			<p>They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Why should you be beaten anymore?</p>
			<p>Why do you persist in rebellion?</p>
			<p>Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness—only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege.</p>
			<p id="filepos6207695"><sup>9</sup>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>“The multitude of your sacrifices—what are they to me?” says the LORD.</p>
			<p>“I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals;</p>
			<p>I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Stop bringing meaningless offerings!</p>
			<p>Your incense is detestable to me.</p>
			<p>New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations—</p>
			<p>I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals</p>
			<p>I hate with all my being.</p>
			<p>They have become a burden to me;</p>
			<p>I am weary of bearing them.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>When you spread out your hands in prayer,</p>
			<p>I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers,</p>
			<p>I am not listening.</p>
			<p>Your hands are full of blood!</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Wash and make yourselves clean.</p>
			<p>Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Learn to do right; seek justice.</p>
			<p>Defend the oppressed.<a id="filepos6213551" href="055.html#filepos7036105"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
			<p>Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>“Come now, let us settle the matter,” says the LORD.</p>
			<p>“Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land;</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.”</p>
			<p>For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>See how the faithful city has become a prostitute!</p>
			<p>She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her—but now murderers!</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Your rulers are rebels, partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts.</p>
			<p>They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow’s case does not come before them.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares:</p>
			<p>“Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>I will turn my hand against you;<a id="filepos6218896" href="055.html#filepos7036371"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
			<p>I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>I will restore your leaders as in days of old, your rulers as at the beginning.</p>
			<p>Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Zion will be delivered with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.”</p>

		<h4>The Mountain of the LORD</h4>

		<p><sup>2</sup>In the last days</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</p>

			<p>The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples.</p>
			<p>They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.</p>

		<h4>The Day of the LORD</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>6</sup>You, LORD, have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob.</p>
			<p>They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures.</p>
			<p>Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>So people will be brought low and everyone humbled—do not forgive them.<a id="filepos6229314" href="055.html#filepos7036737"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from the fearful presence of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled and human pride brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted</p>
			<p>(and they will be humbled),</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>for every trading ship<a id="filepos6232369" href="055.html#filepos7036987"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and every stately vessel.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>and the idols will totally disappear.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>In that day people will throw away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from the fearful presence of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Stop trusting in mere humans, who have but a breath in their nostrils.</p>
			<p>Why hold them in esteem?</p>

		<h4>Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>the hero and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.</p>

			<p><sup>5</sup>People will oppress each other—man against man, neighbor against neighbor.</p>
			<p>The young will rise up against the old, the nobody against the honored.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>A man will seize one of his brothers in his father’s house, and say,</p>
			<p>“You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!”</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>But in that day he will cry out,</p>
			<p>“I have no remedy.</p>
			<p>I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people.”</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Jerusalem staggers,</p>
			<p>Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it.</p>
			<p>Woe to them!</p>
			<p>They have brought disaster upon themselves.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Woe to the wicked!</p>
			<p>Disaster is upon them!</p>
			<p>They will be paid back for what their hands have done.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>Youths oppress my people, women rule over them.</p>
			<p>My people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people:</p>
			<p>“It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>The LORD says,</p>
			<p>“The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, strutting along with swaying hips, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>18</sup>In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, <sup>19</sup>the earrings and bracelets and veils, <sup>20</sup>the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, <sup>21</sup>the signet rings and nose rings, <sup>22</sup>the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses <sup>23</sup>and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>24</sup>Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;</p>
			<p>destitute, she will sit on the ground.</p>

		<h4>The Song of the Vineyard</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard:</p>
			<p>My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines.</p>
			<p>He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well.</p>
			<p>Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>“Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it?</p>
			<p>When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard:</p>
			<p>I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed;</p>
			<p>I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there.</p>
			<p>I will command the clouds not to rain on it.”</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the nation of Israel, and the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in.</p>

		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>8</sup>Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath<a id="filepos6258935" href="055.html#filepos7038222"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of wine; a homer<a id="filepos6259163" href="055.html#filepos7038489"><sup>[9]</sup></a> of seed will yield only an ephah<a id="filepos6259281" href="055.html#filepos7038770"><sup>[10]</sup></a> of grain.”</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>They have harps and lyres at their banquets, pipes and timbrels and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; those of high rank will die of hunger and the common people will be parched with thirst.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore Death expands its jaws, opening wide its mouth; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>So people will be brought low and everyone humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.</p>

			<p><sup>18</sup>Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>to those who say, “Let God hurry; let him hasten his work so we may see it.</p>
			<p>The plan of the Holy One of Israel—let it approach, let it come into view, so we may know it.”</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>Therefore the LORD’s anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down.</p>
			<p>The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.</p>
			<p>Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.</p>
			<p>Here they come, swiftly and speedily!</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal strap is broken.</p>
			<p><sup>28</sup>Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses’ hooves seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea.</p>
			<p>And if one looks at the land, there is only darkness and distress; even the sun will be darkened by clouds.</p>

	<p>Isaiah’s Commission</p>
	<p><sup>1</sup>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. <sup>2</sup>Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. <sup id="filepos6273202">3</sup>And they were calling to one another:</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><sup>4</sup>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</p>
	<p><sup>5</sup>“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.”</p>
	<p><sup>6</sup>Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. <sup>7</sup>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”</p>
	<p><sup>8</sup>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”</p>
	<p>And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”</p>
	<p id="filepos6274972"><sup>9</sup>He said, “Go and tell this people:</p>

		<p>“ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’</p>

		<h4>The Sign of Immanuel</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with<a id="filepos6279645" href="055.html#filepos7040053"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Ephraim”; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.</p>
		<p id="filepos6279884"><sup>3</sup>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub,<a id="filepos6280070" href="055.html#filepos7040305"><sup>[14]</sup></a> to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field. <sup>4</sup>Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. <sup>5</sup>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, <sup>6</sup>“Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” <sup>7</sup>Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“ ‘It will not take place, it will not happen,</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin.</p>
			<p>Within sixty-five years</p>
			<p>Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son.</p>
			<p>If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.’ ”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, <sup>11</sup>“Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans?

		<p><sup>11</sup>All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn!</p>
		<p>You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>You said in your heart,</p>
		<p>“I will ascend to the heavens;</p>
		<p>I will raise my throne above the stars of God;</p>
		<p>I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.<a id="filepos6367150" href="055.html#filepos7047515"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;</p>
		<p>I will make myself like the Most High.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate:</p>
		<p>“Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble,</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit.</p>
		<p>Like a corpse trampled underfoot,</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people.</p>
		<p>Let the offspring of the wicked never be mentioned again.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the sins of their ancestors; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>“I will rise up against them,” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
		<p>“I will wipe out Babylon’s name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,” declares the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>“I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland;</p>
		<p>I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>

	<p><sup>24</sup>The LORD Almighty has sworn,</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p>“Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will happen.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down.</p>
		<p>His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.</p>
		<p><sup>27</sup>For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him?</p>
		<p>His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?</p>

		<h4>A Prophecy Against the Philistines</h4>
		<p><sup>28</sup>This prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>29</sup>Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety.</p>
			<p>But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>Wail, you gate! Howl, you city!</p>
			<p>Melt away, all you Philistines!</p>
			<p>A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks.</p>
			<p><sup>32</sup>What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation?</p>
			<p>“The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.”</p>

		<h4>A Prophecy Against Moab</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>A prophecy against Moab:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!</p>
			<p>Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!</p>
			<p id="filepos6379882"><sup>2</sup>Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep;</p>
			<p>Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba.</p>
			<p>Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail,</p>
			<p>prostrate with weeping.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.</p>
			<p>Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah.</p>
			<p>They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>The waters of Dimon<a id="filepos6384746" href="055.html#filepos7047936"><sup>[38]</sup></a> are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon<a id="filepos6385016" href="055.html#filepos7048310"><sup>[39]</sup></a>—a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.</p>
