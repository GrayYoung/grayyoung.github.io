	<p>A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple.<a id="filepos4596652" href="045.html#filepos5549938"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Of David.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos4596808"><sup>1</sup>I will exalt you, LORD,</p>
		<p>for you lifted me out of the depths</p>
		<p>and did not let my enemies gloat over me.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>LORD my God, I called to you for help,</p>
		<p>and you healed me.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>You, LORD, brought me up from the realm of the dead;</p>
		<p>you spared me from going down to the pit.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Sing the praises of the LORD, you his faithful people;</p>
		<p>praise his holy name.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>For his anger lasts only a moment,</p>
		<p>but his favor lasts a lifetime;</p>
		<p>weeping may stay for the night,</p>
		<p>but rejoicing comes in the morning.</p>
		<br/>
		<p><sup>6</sup>When I felt secure, I said,</p>
		<p>“I will never be shaken.”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>LORD, when you favored me,</p>
		<p>you made my royal mountain<a id="filepos4599838" href="045.html#filepos5550174"><sup>[67]</sup></a> stand firm;</p>
		<p>but when you hid your face,</p>
		<p>I was dismayed.</p>
		<br/>
		<p><sup>8</sup>To you, LORD, I called;</p>
		<p>to the Lord I cried for mercy:</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>“What is gained if I am silenced,</p>
		<p>if I go down to the pit?</p>
		<p>Will the dust praise you?</p>
		<p>Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Hear, LORD, and be merciful to me;</p>
		<p>LORD, be my help.”</p>
		<br/>
		<p><sup>11</sup>You turned my wailing into dancing;</p>
		<p>you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.</p>
		<p>LORD my God, I will praise you forever.</p>

		<p id="filepos4604813"><sup>5</sup>Into your hands I commit my spirit;</p>
		<p>deliver me, LORD, my faithful God.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>I hate those who cling to worthless idols;</p>
		<p>as for me, I trust in the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in your love,</p>
		<p>for you saw my affliction</p>
		<p>and knew the anguish of my soul.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>You have not given me into the hands of the enemy</p>

		<p>my eyes grow weak with sorrow,</p>
		<p>my soul and body with grief.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>My life is consumed by anguish</p>

		<p>my strength fails because of my affliction,<a id="filepos4607456" href="045.html#filepos5550856"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>
		<p>and my bones grow weak.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Because of all my enemies,</p>
		<p>I am the utter contempt of my neighbors</p>
		<p>and an object of dread to my closest friends—</p>
		<p>those who see me on the street flee from me.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>I am forgotten as though I were dead;</p>
		<p>I have become like broken pottery.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>For I hear many whispering,</p>
		<p>“Terror on every side!”</p>
		<p>They conspire against me</p>
		<p>and plot to take my life.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>But I trust in you, LORD;</p>
		<p>I say, “You are my God.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>My times are in your hands;</p>
		<p>deliver me from the hands of my enemies,</p>
		<p>from those who pursue me.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Let your face shine on your servant;</p>
		<p>save me in your unfailing love.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Let me not be put to shame, LORD,</p>
		<p>for I have cried out to you;</p>
		<p>but let the wicked be put to shame</p>
		<p>and be silent in the realm of the dead.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Let their lying lips be silenced,</p>
		<p>for with pride and contempt</p>
		<p>they speak arrogantly against the righteous.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>How abundant are the good things</p>
		<p>that you have stored up for those who fear you,</p>
		<p>that you bestow in the sight of all,</p>
		<p>on those who take refuge in you.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>In the shelter of your presence you hide them</p>
		<p>from all human intrigues;</p>
		<p>you keep them safe in your dwelling</p>
		<p>from accusing tongues.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Praise be to the LORD,</p>
		<p>for he showed me the wonders of his love</p>
		<p>when I was in a city under siege.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>In my alarm I said,</p>
		<p>“I am cut off from your sight!”</p>
		<p>Yet you heard my cry for mercy</p>
		<p>when I called to you for help.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Love the LORD, all his faithful people!</p>
		<p>The LORD preserves those who are true to him,</p>

		<p>and keep them alive in famine.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>We wait in hope for the LORD;</p>
		<p>he is our help and our shield.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>In him our hearts rejoice,</p>
