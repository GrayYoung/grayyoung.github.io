	<p>A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple.<a id="filepos4596652" href="045.html#filepos5549938"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Of David.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos4596808"><sup>1</sup>I will exalt you, LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>LORD my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>You, LORD, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Sing the praises of the LORD, you his faithful people; praise his holy name.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>LORD, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain<a id="filepos4599838" href="045.html#filepos5550174"><sup>[67]</sup></a> stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>To you, LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>“What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit?</p>
		<p>Will the dust praise you?</p>
		<p>Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Hear, LORD, and be merciful to me;</p>
		<p>LORD, be my help.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, <sup>12</sup>that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.</p>
		<p>LORD my God, I will praise you forever.</p>

	<p>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</p>
	<blockquote  title="poetry">
		<p id="filepos4602946"><sup>1</sup>In you, LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>Keep me free from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.</p>
		<p id="filepos4604813"><sup>5</sup>Into your hands I commit my spirit; deliver me, LORD, my faithful God.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>I hate those who cling to worthless idols; as for me, I trust in the LORD.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>You have not given me into the hands of the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and body with grief.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction,<a id="filepos4607456" href="045.html#filepos5550856"><sup>[69]</sup></a> and my bones grow weak.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors and an object of dread to my closest friends—those who see me on the street flee from me.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>I am forgotten as though I were dead;</p>
		<p>I have become like broken pottery.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>For I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side!”</p>
		<p>They conspire against me and plot to take my life.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>But I trust in you, LORD;</p>
		<p>I say, “You are my God.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>My times are in your hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>Let me not be put to shame, LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and be silent in the realm of the dead.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>How abundant are the good things that you have stored up for those who fear you, that you bestow in the sight of all, on those who take refuge in you.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>In the shelter of your presence you hide them from all human intrigues; you keep them safe in your dwelling from accusing tongues.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>Praise be to the LORD, for he showed me the wonders of his love when I was in a city under siege.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight!”</p>
		<p>Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Love the LORD, all his faithful people!</p>
		<p>The LORD preserves those who are true to him, but the proud he pays back in full.</p>
		<p><sup>24</sup>Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>He gathers the waters of the sea into jars<a id="filepos4624834" href="045.html#filepos5552011"><sup>[72]</sup></a>; he puts the deep into storehouses.</p>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Brandish spear and javelin<a id="filepos4640793" href="045.html#filepos5553140"><sup>[75]</sup></a> against those who pursue me.</p>
		<p>Say to me, “I am your salvation.”</p>

		<p><sup>5</sup>May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me, <sup>8</sup>may ruin overtake them by surprise—may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>My whole being will exclaim, “Who is like you, LORD?</p>
		<p>You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.”</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved.</p>

		<p>I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge.</p>
		<p>They slandered me without ceasing.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;<a id="filepos4647330" href="045.html#filepos5553392"><sup>[76]</sup></a> they gnashed their teeth at me.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>How long, Lord, will you look on?</p>
		<p>Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</p>

		<p><sup>13</sup>This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.<a id="filepos4761345" href="045.html#filepos5568645"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd</p>

		<p>Their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.</p>
		<p id="filepos4762338"><sup>15</sup>But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases;</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Though while they live they count themselves blessed—and people praise you when you prosper—</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.</p>

	<p>A psalm of Asaph.</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p><sup>1</sup>The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>“Gather to me this consecrated people, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.<a id="filepos4767393" href="045.html#filepos5569131"><sup>[122]</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="filepos4767492" href="045.html#filepos5569449"><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>“Listen, my people, and I will speak;</p>
		<p>I will testify against you, Israel:</p>
		<p>I am God, your God.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens, <sup>10</sup>for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>“Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High, <sup>15</sup>and call on me in the day of trouble;</p>
		<p>I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup>But to the wicked person, God says:</p>
	<blockquote title="poetry">
		<p>“What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother’s son.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly<a id="filepos4773191" href="045.html#filepos5569738"><sup>[124]</sup></a> like you.</p>
		<p>But I now arraign you and set my accusations before you.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>“Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless<a id="filepos4774402" href="045.html#filepos5570045"><sup>[125]</sup></a> I will show my salvation.”</p>
