		<h4>An Invasion of Locusts</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>2</sup>Hear this, you elders;</p>
			<p>listen, all who live in the land.</p>
			<p>Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors?</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts<a id="filepos8572842" href="#filepos8621655"><sup>[1]</sup></a> have eaten.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!</p>
			<p>Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>A nation has invaded my land, a mighty army without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees.</p>
			<p>It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving for the betrothed of her youth.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD.</p>
			<p>The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>Despair, you farmers,</p>
			<p>wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple<a id="filepos8578055" href="#filepos8621958"><sup>[2]</sup></a> tree— all the trees of the field—are dried up.</p>
			<p>Surely the people’s joy is withered away.</p>

		<h4>A Call to Lamentation</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>13</sup>Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn;</p>
			<p>wail, you who minister before the altar.</p>
			<p>Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly.</p>
			<p>Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Alas for that day!</p>
			<p>For the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.<a id="filepos8581345" href="#filepos8622208"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes— joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods.<a id="filepos8582384" href="#filepos8622453"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
			<p>The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up.</p>
			<p><sup>18</sup>How the cattle moan!</p>
			<p>The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>To you, LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness.</p>

		<h4>An Army of Locusts</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>1</sup>Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill.</p>
			<p>Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming.</p>
			<p>It is close at hand—</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup>a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness.</p>
			<p>Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes, such as never was in ancient times nor ever will be in ages to come.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup>Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes.</p>
			<p>Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste— nothing escapes them.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>They have the appearance of horses; they gallop along like cavalry.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup>At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; every face turns pale.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers.</p>
			<p>They all march in line, not swerving from their course.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead.</p>
			<p>They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>They rush upon the city; they run along the wall.</p>
			<p>They climb into the houses; like thieves they enter through the windows.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Before them the earth shakes, the heavens tremble, the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys his command.</p>
			<p>The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful.</p>
			<p>Who can endure it?</p>

		<h4>Rend Your Heart</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Even now,” declares the LORD,</p>
			<p>“return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”</p>
			<p><sup>13</sup>Rend your heart and not your garments.</p>
			<p>Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.</p>
			<p><sup>14</sup>Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing— grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God.</p>
			<p><sup>15</sup>Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly.</p>
			<p><sup>16</sup>Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast.</p>
			<p>Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.</p>
			<p><sup>17</sup>Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the portico and the altar.</p>
			<p>Let them say, “Spare your people, LORD.</p>
			<p>Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations.</p>
			<p>Why should they say among the peoples,</p>
			<p>‘Where is their God?’ ”</p>

		<h4>The LORD’s Answer</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p><sup>18</sup>Then the LORD was jealous for his land and took pity on his people.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>19</sup>The LORD replied<a id="filepos8598782" href="#filepos8622844"><sup>[5]</sup></a> to them:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>“I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land; its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
			<p>And its stench will go up; its smell will rise.”</p>
			<p>Surely he has done great things!</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>Do not be afraid, land of Judah; be glad and rejoice.</p>
			<p>Surely the LORD has done great things!</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>Do not be afraid, you wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green.</p>
			<p>The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful.</p>
			<p>He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</p>
			<p><sup>25</sup>“I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm<a id="filepos8603870" href="#filepos8623241"><sup>[6]</sup></a>— my great army that I sent among you.</p>
			<p><sup>26</sup>You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.</p>
			<p><sup>27</sup>Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed.</p>

		<h4>The Day of the LORD</h4>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p id="filepos8605798"><sup>28</sup>“And afterward,</p>
			<p>I will pour out my Spirit on all people.</p>
			<p>Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.</p>
			<p><sup>29</sup>Even on my servants, both men and women,</p>
			<p>I will pour out my Spirit in those days.</p>
			<p><sup>30</sup>I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.</p>
			<p><sup>31</sup>The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.</p>
			<p id="filepos8608025"><sup>32</sup>And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, even among the survivors whom the LORD calls.<a id="filepos8609181" href="#filepos8623545"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
