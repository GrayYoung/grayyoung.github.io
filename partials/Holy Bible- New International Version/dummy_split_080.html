<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>When his time of service was completed, he returned home. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>“The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>“How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called<a id="filepos9640636" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos9932328" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> the Son of God. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>For no word from God will ever fail.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">38</sup>“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <sup class="calibre23">44</sup>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. <sup class="calibre23">45</sup>Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So Jesus went with them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, <span><span class="calibre46">“I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.”</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, <span><span class="calibre46">“Don’t cry.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span><span class="calibre46">“Young man, I say to you, get up!”</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>So he replied to the messengers, <span><span class="calibre46">“Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy</span></span><a id="filepos9717117" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos9939566" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[25]</sup></span></a><span><span class="calibre46"> are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</span></span>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He told them: <span><span class="calibre46">“Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">4</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">5</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>He replied, <span><span class="calibre46">“You give them something to eat.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.” <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>(About five thousand men were there.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>But he said to his disciples, <span><span class="calibre46">“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">20</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“But what about you?”</span></span> he asked. <span><span class="calibre46">“Who do you say I am?”</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>They spoke about his departure,<a id="filepos9747755" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos9941707" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[31]</sup></span></a> which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. <sup id="filepos9748495" class="calibre23">35</sup>A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.” <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">37</sup>The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">41</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“You unbelieving and perverse generation,”</span></span> Jesus replied, <span><span class="calibre46">“how long shall I stay with you and put up with you?

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">42</sup>Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion.

<sup class="calibre23">45</sup>But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">46</sup>An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. <sup class="calibre23">47</sup>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. <sup class="calibre23">48</sup>Then he said to them, <span><span class="calibre46">“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">49</sup>“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">50</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“Do not stop him,”</span></span> Jesus said, <span><span class="calibre46">“for whoever is not against you is for you.”</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then Jesus told them this parable: <span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">4</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Jesus continued: <span><span class="calibre46">“There was a man who had two sons.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">12</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> So he divided his property</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> between them.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">13</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> in wild living.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">14</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">15</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">16</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">17</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">18</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> against heaven and against you.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">19</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">20</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">So he got up and went to his father.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46">“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">21</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">22</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> and sandals on his feet.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">23</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</span></span>

<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">25</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">26</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">27</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">28</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“The older brother became angry</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">29</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">30</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">But when this son of yours who has squandered your property</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> with prostitutes</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">31</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">32</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”</span></span></span></p>
