<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>the word of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<a id="filepos7875196" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8257096" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[1]</sup></span></a> There the hand of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was on him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<a id="filepos7878863" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8257338" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Ezekiel’s Call to Be a Prophet</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>He said to me, “Son of man,<a id="filepos7880438" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8257700" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> says.’ <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="filepos7882181" class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre22"><span class="calibre21"><a href="dummy_split_004.html#filepos172446" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10">Ezekiel 3</span></a></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.” <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</span></p>
<p id="filepos7882664" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel— <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> rose from the place where it was standing.<a id="filepos7884533" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8258277" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">13</sup>It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> on me. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Ezekiel’s Task as Watchman</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>At the end of seven days the word of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for<a id="filepos7885841" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8258668" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. <sup id="filepos7885987" class="calibre23">19</sup>But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.</span></p>
<p id="filepos7886203" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>“Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The hand of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came on me there. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man.<a id="filepos7920418" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8261795" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[14]</sup></span></a> From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.” <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> does not see us; the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has forsaken the land.’ ” <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose! <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Then the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about<a id="filepos7930269" href="dummy_split_062.html#filepos8262414" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[16]</sup></span></a> as the cherubim went.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Then the cherubim rose upward.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River.
