<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</span></p>

<p id="filepos924854" class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods<a id="filepos925067" href="#filepos1018404" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[96]</sup></span></a> who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>.” <sup id="filepos926203" class="calibre23">6</sup>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. <sup id="filepos926662" class="calibre23">8</sup>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“I have seen these people,” the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>But Moses sought the favor of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> his God. “<span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ” <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Moses replied:</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><div title="poetry" class="calibre1">

<br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>“Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil. <sup id="filepos930558" class="calibre23">23</sup>They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’ <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Then he said to them, “This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’ ” <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos932398" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>So Moses went back to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>For the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> spoke with Moses. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend.

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Moses and the Glory of the <span><span class="calibre31">LORD</span></span></span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us?

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. <sup id="filepos973629" class="calibre23">7</sup>Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>

<p id="filepos973967" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>It was square—a span<a id="filepos974255" href="#filepos1028135" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[125]</sup></span></a> long and a span wide—and folded double. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver— <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: <span><span class="calibre8">HOLY TO THE LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Moses: <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>“Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>“Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Bring his sons and dress them in tunics. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.” <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Moses did everything just as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>and set out the bread on it before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>and set up the lamps before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> filled the tabernacle. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> filled the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>So the cloud of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.</span></p>
