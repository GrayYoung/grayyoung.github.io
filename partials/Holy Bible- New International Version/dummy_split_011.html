<p><span><span>The Priestly Garments</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>“Have Aaron your brother brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, so they may serve me as priests. <sup>2</sup>Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron to give him dignity and honor. <sup>3</sup>Tell all the skilled workers to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as priest. <sup>4</sup>These are the garments they are to make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so they may serve me as priests. <sup>5</sup>Have them use gold, and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Ephod</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>“Make the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen—the work of skilled hands. <sup>7</sup>It is to have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners, so it can be fastened. <sup>8</sup>Its skillfully woven waistband is to be like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>“Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel <sup>10</sup>in the order of their birth—six names on one stone and the remaining six on the other. <sup>11</sup>Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings <sup>12</sup>and fasten them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear the names on his shoulders as a memorial before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>13</sup>Make gold filigree settings <sup>14</sup>and two braided chains of pure gold, like a rope, and attach the chains to the settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Breastpiece</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>“Fashion a breastpiece for making decisions—the work of skilled hands. Make it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup>16</sup>It is to be square—a span<a id="filepos899909" href="#filepos1014216"><span><sup>[83]</sup></span></a> long and a span wide—and folded double. <sup>17</sup>Then mount four rows of precious stones on it. The first row shall be carnelian, chrysolite and beryl; <sup>18</sup>the second row shall be turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald; <sup>19</sup>the third row shall be jacinth, agate and amethyst; <sup>20</sup>the fourth row shall be topaz, onyx and jasper.<a id="filepos900357" href="#filepos1014489"><span><sup>[84]</sup></span></a> Mount them in gold filigree settings. <sup>21</sup>There are to be twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>“For the breastpiece make braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. <sup>23</sup>Make two gold rings for it and fasten them to two corners of the breastpiece. <sup>24</sup>Fasten the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, <sup>25</sup>and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. <sup>26</sup>Make two gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. <sup>27</sup>Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. <sup>28</sup>The rings of the breastpiece are to be tied to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband, so that the breastpiece will not swing out from the ephod.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>“Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he will bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of decision as a continuing memorial before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>30</sup>Also put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece, so they may be over Aaron’s heart whenever he enters the presence of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. Thus Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Other Priestly Garments</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>“Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth, <sup>32</sup>with an opening for the head in its center. There shall be a woven edge like a collar<a id="filepos902706" href="#filepos1014788"><span><sup>[85]</sup></span></a> around this opening, so that it will not tear. <sup>33</sup>Make pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them. <sup>34</sup>The gold bells and the pomegranates are to alternate around the hem of the robe. <sup>35</sup>Aaron must wear it when he ministers. The sound of the bells will be heard when he enters the Holy Place before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and when he comes out, so that he will not die.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>36</sup>“Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: <span><span>HOLY TO THE LORD</span></span>. <sup>37</sup>Fasten a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban; it is to be on the front of the turban. <sup>38</sup>It will be on Aaron’s forehead, and he will bear the guilt involved in the sacred gifts the Israelites consecrate, whatever their gifts may be. It will be on Aaron’s forehead continually so that they will be acceptable to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>39</sup>“Weave the tunic of fine linen and make the turban of fine linen. The sash is to be the work of an embroiderer. <sup>40</sup>Make tunics, sashes and caps for Aaron’s sons to give them dignity and honor. <sup>41</sup>After you put these clothes on your brother Aaron and his sons, anoint and ordain them. Consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>“Make linen undergarments as a covering for the body, reaching from the waist to the thigh. <sup>43</sup>Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Consecration of the Priests</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>“This is what you are to do to consecrate them, so they may serve me as priests: Take a young bull and two rams without defect. <sup>2</sup>And from the finest wheat flour make round loaves without yeast, thick loaves without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves without yeast and brushed with olive oil. <sup>3</sup>Put them in a basket and present them along with the bull and the two rams. <sup>4</sup>Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water. <sup>5</sup>Take the garments and dress Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself and the breastpiece. Fasten the ephod on him by its skillfully woven waistband. <sup>6</sup>Put the turban on his head and attach the sacred emblem to the turban. <sup>7</sup>Take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head. <sup>8</sup>Bring his sons and dress them in tunics <sup>9</sup>and fasten caps on them. Then tie sashes on Aaron and his sons.<a id="filepos906365" href="#filepos1015184"><span><sup>[86]</sup></span></a> The priesthood is theirs by a lasting ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span>“Then you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“Bring the bull to the front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. <sup>11</sup>Slaughter it in the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s presence at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <sup>12</sup>Take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar. <sup>13</sup>Then take all the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar. <sup>14</sup>But burn the bull’s flesh and its hide and its intestines outside the camp. It is a sin offering.<a id="filepos907435" href="#filepos1015442"><span><sup>[87]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>“Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. <sup>16</sup>Slaughter it and take the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar. <sup>17</sup>Cut the ram into pieces and wash the internal organs and the legs, putting them with the head and the other pieces. <sup>18</sup>Then burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>“Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. <sup>20</sup>Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then splash blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>21</sup>And take some blood from the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. Then he and his sons and their garments will be consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>“Take from this ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. (This is the ram for the ordination.) <sup>23</sup>From the basket of bread made without yeast, which is before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, take one round loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf. <sup>24</sup>Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them wave them before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> as a wave offering. <sup>25</sup>Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, a food offering presented to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>26</sup>After you take the breast of the ram for Aaron’s ordination, wave it before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> as a wave offering, and it will be your share.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>“Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. <sup>28</sup>This is always to be the perpetual share from the Israelites for Aaron and his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> from their fellowship offerings.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>“Aaron’s sacred garments will belong to his descendants so that they can be anointed and ordained in them. <sup>30</sup>The son who succeeds him as priest and comes to the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place is to wear them seven days.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>“Take the ram for the ordination and cook the meat in a sacred place. <sup>32</sup>At the entrance to the tent of meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket. <sup>33</sup>They are to eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred. <sup>34</sup>And if any of the meat of the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>35</sup>“Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them. <sup id="filepos911633">36</sup>Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it. <sup>37</sup>For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will be holy.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>38</sup>“This is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs a year old. <sup>39</sup>Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight. <sup>40</sup>With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah<a id="filepos912260" href="#filepos1015770"><span><sup>[88]</sup></span></a> of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin<a id="filepos912396" href="#filepos1016055"><span><sup>[89]</sup></span></a> of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. <sup>41</sup>Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and its drink offering as in the morning—a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>“For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. There I will meet you and speak to you; <sup>43</sup>there also I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>44</sup>“So I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar and will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests. <sup>45</sup>Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God. <sup>46</sup>They will know that I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span> their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span> their God.</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Altar of Incense</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>“Make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense. <sup>2</sup>It is to be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high<a id="filepos914301" href="#filepos1016446"><span><sup>[90]</sup></span></a>—its horns of one piece with it. <sup>3</sup>Overlay the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it. <sup>4</sup>Make two gold rings for the altar below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it. <sup>5</sup>Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. <sup>6</sup>Put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law—before the atonement cover that is over the tablets of the covenant law—where I will meet with you.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps. <sup>8</sup>He must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> for the generations to come. <sup>9</sup>Do not offer on this altar any other incense or any burnt offering or grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it. <sup>10</sup>Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering<a id="filepos915627" href="#filepos1016788"><span><sup>[91]</sup></span></a> for the generations to come. It is most holy to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Atonement Money</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>12</sup>“When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the <span><span>LORD</span></span> a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them. <sup>13</sup>Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel,<a id="filepos916446" href="#filepos1017045"><span><sup>[92]</sup></span></a> according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>14</sup>All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup id="filepos916815">15</sup>The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> to atone for your lives. <sup>16</sup>Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, making atonement for your lives.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Basin for Washing</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>18</sup>“Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. <sup>19</sup>Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it. <sup>20</sup>Whenever they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, <sup>21</sup>they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Anointing Oil</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>23</sup>“Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels<a id="filepos918564" href="#filepos1017385"><span><sup>[93]</sup></span></a> of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels<a id="filepos918737" href="#filepos1017733"><span><sup>[94]</sup></span></a> of fragrant calamus, <sup id="filepos918845">24</sup>500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin<a id="filepos918939" href="#filepos1018009"><span><sup>[95]</sup></span></a> of olive oil. <sup>25</sup>Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil. <sup>26</sup>Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law, <sup>27</sup>the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, <sup>28</sup>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. <sup>29</sup>You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>“Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests. <sup>31</sup>Say to the Israelites, ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. <sup>32</sup>Do not pour it on anyone else’s body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred. <sup>33</sup>Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Incense</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>34</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts, <sup>35</sup>and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred. <sup>36</sup>Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. <sup>37</sup>Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>38</sup>Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Bezalel and Oholiab</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>2</sup>“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <sup>3</sup>and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills— <sup>4</sup>to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, <sup>5</sup>to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts. <sup>6</sup>Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you: <sup>7</sup>the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent— <sup>8</sup>the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense, <sup>9</sup>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand— <sup>10</sup>and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests, <sup>11</sup>and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Sabbath</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>13</sup>“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, who makes you holy.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>“ ‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people. <sup>15</sup>For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death. <sup>16</sup>The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant. <sup>17</sup>It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the <span><span>LORD</span></span> made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>When the <span><span>LORD</span></span> finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>The Golden Calf</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p id="filepos924854"><span><sup>1</sup>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods<a id="filepos925067" href="#filepos1018404"><span><sup>[96]</sup></span></a> who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” <sup>3</sup>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. <sup>4</sup>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods,<a id="filepos925786" href="#filepos1018776"><span><sup>[97]</sup></span></a> Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.” <sup id="filepos926203">6</sup>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. <sup id="filepos926662">8</sup>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>“I have seen these people,” the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people. <sup>10</sup>Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>But Moses sought the favor of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> his God. “<span><span>LORD</span></span>,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? <sup>12</sup>Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. <sup>13</sup>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ” <sup>14</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. <sup>16</sup>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>Moses replied:</span></p>
<br/><div title="poetry">
<blockquote><p><span>“It is not the sound of victory,</span></p></blockquote><div> </div>
<blockquote><p><span>it is not the sound of defeat;</span></p></blockquote><div> </div>
<blockquote><p><span>it is the sound of singing that I hear.”</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><p><span><sup>19</sup>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. <sup>20</sup>And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>“Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil. <sup id="filepos930558">23</sup>They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’ <sup>24</sup>So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. <sup>26</sup>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>Then he said to them, “This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’ ” <sup>28</sup>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. <sup>29</sup>Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos932398"><span><sup>31</sup>So Moses went back to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. <sup>32</sup>But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>33</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. <sup>34</sup>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>35</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ <sup>2</sup>I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. <sup>3</sup>Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments. <sup>5</sup>For the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’ ” <sup>6</sup>So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Tent of Meeting</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. <sup>8</sup>And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. <sup>9</sup>As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the <span><span>LORD</span></span> spoke with Moses. <sup>10</sup>Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. <sup>11</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Moses and the Glory of the <span><span>LORD</span></span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>Moses said to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favor with me.’ <sup>13</sup>If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. <sup>16</sup>How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos937920"><span><sup>19</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. <sup>20</sup>But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. <sup>22</sup>When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. <sup>23</sup>Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The New Stone Tablets</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. <sup>2</sup>Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. <sup>3</sup>No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. <sup>5</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>6</sup>And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, <sup>7</sup>maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. <sup>9</sup>“Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said: “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, will do for you. <sup>11</sup>Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. <sup>12</sup>Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you. <sup>13</sup>Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.<a id="filepos941971" href="#filepos1019214"><span><sup>[98]</sup></span></a>
<sup>14</sup>Do not worship any other god, for the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>“Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices. <sup>16</sup>And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>“Do not make any idols.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>“The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock. <sup>20</sup>Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons.</span></p>
<p><span>“No one is to appear before me empty-handed.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>“Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>“Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.<a id="filepos944161" href="#filepos1019486"><span><sup>[99]</sup></span></a>
<sup>23</sup>Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel. <sup>24</sup>I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>“Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>26</sup>“Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God.</span></p>
<p><span>“Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” <sup>28</sup>Moses was there with the <span><span>LORD</span></span> forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water.

<p><span><sup>29</sup>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>30</sup>When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. <sup>31</sup>But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them. <sup>32</sup>Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had given him on Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>33</sup>When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. <sup>34</sup>But whenever he entered the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out.

<p><span><sup>1</sup>Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has commanded you to do: <sup>2</sup>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.

<p><span><sup>4</sup>Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has commanded: <sup>5</sup>From what you have, take an offering for the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.

<p><span><sup>10</sup>“All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has commanded: <sup>11</sup>the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; <sup>12</sup>the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it; <sup>13</sup>the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence; <sup>14</sup>the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light; <sup>15</sup>the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; <sup>16</sup>the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand; <sup>17</sup>the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; <sup>18</sup>the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes; <sup>19</sup>the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses’ presence, <sup>21</sup>and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments. <sup>22</sup>All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments.

<p><span><span>Bezalel and Oholiab</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <sup>31</sup>and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills— <sup>32</sup>to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, <sup>33</sup>to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts. <sup>34</sup>And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. <sup>35</sup>He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.</span></p>

<p><span><sup>2</sup>Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work. <sup>3</sup>They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning. <sup>4</sup>So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing <sup>5</sup>and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more, <sup>7</sup>because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Tabernacle</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands. <sup>9</sup>All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.<a id="filepos955514" href="#filepos1020308"><span><sup>[101]</sup></span></a>
<sup>10</sup>They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five. <sup>11</sup>Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set. <sup>12</sup>They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. <sup>13</sup>Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether. <sup>15</sup>All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.<a id="filepos956435" href="#filepos1020621"><span><sup>[102]</sup></span></a>
<sup>16</sup>They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set. <sup>17</sup>Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. <sup>18</sup>They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit. <sup>19</sup>Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.<a id="filepos956975" href="#filepos1020935"><span><sup>[103]</sup></span></a></span></p>

<sup>22</sup>with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. <sup>23</sup>They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle <sup>24</sup>and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection. <sup>25</sup>For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames <sup>26</sup>and forty silver bases—two under each frame. <sup>27</sup>They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle, <sup>28</sup>and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end. <sup>29</sup>At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike. <sup>30</sup>So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>31</sup>They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, <sup>32</sup>five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle. <sup>33</sup>They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames. <sup>34</sup>They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>35</sup>They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker. <sup>36</sup>They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases. <sup>37</sup>For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer; <sup>38</sup>and they made five posts with hooks for them.

<p><span><span>The Lampstand</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>They made the lampstand of pure gold.

<p><span><span>The Altar of Burnt Offering</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>They<a id="filepos965309" href="#filepos1023820"><span><sup>[111]</sup></span></a> built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits<a id="filepos965459" href="#filepos1024137"><span><sup>[112]</sup></span></a> high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.<a id="filepos965606" href="#filepos1024408"><span><sup>[113]</sup></span></a>
<sup id="filepos965694">2</sup>They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze. <sup>3</sup>They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans. <sup>4</sup>They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar. <sup>5</sup>They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating. <sup>6</sup>They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. <sup>7</sup>They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Basin for Washing</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Courtyard</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits<a id="filepos967057" href="#filepos1024693"><span><sup>[114]</sup></span></a> long and had curtains of finely twisted linen, <sup>10</sup>with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <sup>11</sup>The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>The west end was fifty cubits<a id="filepos967581" href="#filepos1024961"><span><sup>[115]</sup></span></a> wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <sup>13</sup>The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide. <sup>14</sup>Curtains fifteen cubits<a id="filepos967875" href="#filepos1025229"><span><sup>[116]</sup></span></a> long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases, <sup>15</sup>and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases. <sup>16</sup>All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen. <sup>17</sup>The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits<a id="filepos968722" href="#filepos1025498"><span><sup>[117]</sup></span></a> long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits<a id="filepos968867" href="#filepos1025765"><span><sup>[118]</sup></span></a> high, <sup>19</sup>with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. <sup>20</sup>All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Materials Used</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. <sup>22</sup>(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses; <sup>23</sup>with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.) <sup>24</sup>The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels,<a id="filepos970096" href="#filepos1026037"><span><sup>[119]</sup></span></a> according to the sanctuary shekel.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents<a id="filepos970424" href="#filepos1026333"><span><sup>[120]</sup></span></a> and 1,775 shekels,<a id="filepos970530" href="#filepos1026681"><span><sup>[121]</sup></span></a> according to the sanctuary shekel— <sup>26</sup>one beka per person, that is, half a shekel,<a id="filepos970716" href="#filepos1027025"><span><sup>[122]</sup></span></a> according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men. <sup id="filepos970942">27</sup>The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base. <sup id="filepos971111">28</sup>They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.<a id="filepos971422" href="#filepos1027295"><span><sup>[123]</sup></span></a>
<sup>30</sup>They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils, <sup>31</sup>the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>The Priestly Garments</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Ephod</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>They<a id="filepos972685" href="#filepos1027710"><span><sup>[124]</sup></span></a> made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup>3</sup>They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands. <sup>4</sup>They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened. <sup>5</sup>Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. <sup id="filepos973629">7</sup>Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Breastpiece</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p id="filepos973967"><span><sup>8</sup>They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup>9</sup>It was square—a span<a id="filepos974255" href="#filepos1028135"><span><sup>[125]</sup></span></a> long and a span wide—and folded double. <sup>10</sup>Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl; <sup>11</sup>the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald; <sup>12</sup>the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst; <sup>13</sup>the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper.<a id="filepos974691" href="#filepos1028408"><span><sup>[126]</sup></span></a> They were mounted in gold filigree settings. <sup>14</sup>There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. <sup>16</sup>They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece. <sup>17</sup>They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, <sup>18</sup>and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. <sup>19</sup>They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. <sup>20</sup>Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. <sup>21</sup>They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Other Priestly Garments</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p id="filepos976272"><span><sup>22</sup>They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver— <sup>23</sup>with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar,<a id="filepos976521" href="#filepos1028708"><span><sup>[127]</sup></span></a> and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear. <sup>24</sup>They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe. <sup>25</sup>And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates. <sup>26</sup>The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver— <sup>28</sup>and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen. <sup>29</sup>The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: <span><span>HOLY TO THE LORD</span></span>. <sup>31</sup>Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Moses Inspects the Tabernacle</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>32</sup>So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses. <sup>33</sup>Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; <sup>34</sup>the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of another durable leather<a id="filepos978628" href="#filepos1028988"><span><sup>[128]</sup></span></a> and the shielding curtain; <sup>35</sup>the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover; <sup>36</sup>the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence; <sup>37</sup>the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light; <sup>38</sup>the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; <sup>39</sup>the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; <sup>40</sup>the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; <sup>41</sup>and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>42</sup>The Israelites had done all the work just as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had commanded Moses. <sup>43</sup>Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had commanded. So Moses blessed them.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Setting Up the Tabernacle</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses: <sup>2</sup>“Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month. <sup>3</sup>Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain. <sup>4</sup>Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps. <sup>5</sup>Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant law and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>“Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; <sup>7</sup>place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it. <sup>8</sup>Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy. <sup>10</sup>Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy. <sup>11</sup>Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water. <sup>13</sup>Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest. <sup>14</sup>Bring his sons and dress them in tunics. <sup>15</sup>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.” <sup>16</sup>Moses did everything just as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. <sup>18</sup>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts. <sup>19</sup>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. <sup>21</sup>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain <sup>23</sup>and set out the bread on it before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle <sup>25</sup>and set up the lamps before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>26</sup>Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain <sup>27</sup>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>28</sup>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. <sup>29</sup>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, <sup>31</sup>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. <sup>32</sup>They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>33</sup>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Glory of the <span><span>LORD</span></span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>34</sup>Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> filled the tabernacle. <sup>35</sup>Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> filled the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>36</sup>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; <sup>37</sup>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted. <sup>38</sup>So the cloud of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.</span></p>
