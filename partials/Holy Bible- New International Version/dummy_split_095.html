<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Lord’s Grace to Paul</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.

This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10917048" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>In the same way, deacons<a id="filepos10917147" href="#filepos10933021" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</span></p>

<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters,<a id="filepos10920909" href="#filepos10934242" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a> you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Command and teach these things. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Watch your life and doctrine closely.

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Widows, Elders and Slaves</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,”<a id="filepos10925886" href="#filepos10934725" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> and “The worker deserves his wages.”<a id="filepos10926020" href="#filepos10935012" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[10]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.</span></p>

They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But godliness with contentment is great gain. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.</span></p>
