<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Blood of Christ</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here,<a id="filepos11014135" href="#filepos11061321" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[40]</sup></span></a> he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining<a id="filepos11014514" href="#filepos11061587" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[41]</sup></span></a> eternal redemption. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death,<a id="filepos11014965" href="#filepos11061844" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[42]</sup></span></a> so that we may serve the living God!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>In the case of a will,<a id="filepos11015568" href="#filepos11062099" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[43]</sup></span></a> it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, <sup id="filepos11015714" class="calibre23">17</sup>because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”<a id="filepos11016252" href="#filepos11062429" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[44]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">21</sup>In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>This is what the ancients were commended for.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.”<a id="filepos11028975" href="#filepos11065423" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[53]</sup></span></a> For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she<a id="filepos11030279" href="#filepos11065710" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[54]</sup></span></a> considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.<a id="filepos11034245" href="#filepos11066393" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[56]</sup></span></a></span></p>

There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>They were put to death by stoning;<a id="filepos11035200" href="#filepos11066640" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[57]</sup></span></a> they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated— <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</span></p>
