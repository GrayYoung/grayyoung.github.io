<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>I thank my God every time I remember you. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul’s Chains Advance the Gospel</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,<a id="filepos10828146" href="#filepos10848061" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard<a id="filepos10828383" href="#filepos10848847" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. <sup id="filepos10828522" class="calibre23">14</sup>And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.<a id="filepos10829599" href="#filepos10849093" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">20</sup>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Life Worthy of the Gospel</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,<a id="filepos10830937" href="#filepos10849359" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> striving together as one for the faith of the gospel <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>because he almost died for the work of Christ.

It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>though I myself have reasons for such confidence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in<a id="filepos10840349" href="#filepos10850623" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. <sup id="filepos10841003" class="calibre23">13</sup>Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Following Paul’s Example</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things.

<p id="filepos10841787" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10842937" class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Let your gentleness be evident to all.

<p id="filepos10844223" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice.

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Thanks for Their Gifts</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></p>
