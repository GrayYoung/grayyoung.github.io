<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all; <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>I weighed out to them 650 talents<a id="filepos3789395" href="#filepos3815403" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[24]</sup></span></a> of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents,<a id="filepos3789530" href="#filepos3815674" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[25]</sup></span></a> 100 talents<a id="filepos3789628" href="#filepos3815949" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[26]</sup></span></a> of gold, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics,<a id="filepos3789777" href="#filepos3816224" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[27]</sup></span></a> and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of your ancestors. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel.” <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering,<a id="filepos3791828" href="#filepos3816496" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[28]</sup></span></a> twelve male goats.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> my God <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>and prayed:</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Now honor<a id="filepos3799575" href="#filepos3817225" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[30]</sup></span></a> the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.” <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.</span></p>
