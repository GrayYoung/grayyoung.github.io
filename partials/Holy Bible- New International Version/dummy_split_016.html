<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Command to Leave Horeb</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had commanded him concerning them. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Appointment of Leaders</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>May the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised! <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself? <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Spies Sent Out</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God is giving us. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>See, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God is giving us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Rebellion Against the <span><span class="calibre31">LORD</span></span></span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>You grumbled in your tents and said, “The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>and in the wilderness. There you saw how the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>In spite of this, you did not trust in the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God, <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>When the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore: <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>“No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, <sup id="filepos1578052" class="calibre23">36</sup>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> wholeheartedly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">37</sup>Because of you the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it. <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.<a id="filepos1578953" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1818797" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[1]</sup></span></a>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">41</sup>Then you replied, “We have sinned against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. We will go up and fight, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">42</sup>But the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">43</sup>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country. <sup class="calibre23">44</sup>The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah. <sup class="calibre23">45</sup>You came back and wept before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you. <sup class="calibre23">46</sup>And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Wanderings in the Wilderness</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea,<a id="filepos1580975" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819168" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> gave them as their possession.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had sworn to them. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>“Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor<a id="filepos1585646" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819417" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> destroyed them and settled in their place.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Defeat of Sihon King of Heshbon</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>“Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot— <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God is giving us.” <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz, <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed<a id="filepos1588037" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819655" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a> them—men, women and children. We left no survivors. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God gave us all of them. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>But in accordance with the command of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors. <sup id="filepos1589879" class="calibre23">4</sup>At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>We completely destroyed<a id="filepos1590232" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820157" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying<a id="filepos1590377" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820537" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a> every city—men, women and children. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. <sup id="filepos1590853" class="calibre23">9</sup>(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide.<a id="filepos1591238" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820917" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[7]</sup></span></a> It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Division of the Land</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.<a id="filepos1592208" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1821280" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a>) <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>And I gave Gilead to Makir. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>I commanded you at that time: “The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>until the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has done to these two kings. The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Do not be afraid of them; the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God himself will fight for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>At that time I pleaded with the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>: <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>“Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do? <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>But because of you the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>You saw with your own eyes what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> did at Baal Peor.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God is near us whenever we pray to him? <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God is giving you as your inheritance. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Be careful not to forget the covenant of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has forbidden. <sup id="filepos1600835" class="calibre23">24</sup>For the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>You were shown these things so that you might know that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> is God; besides him there is no other. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> is God in heaven above and on the earth below.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are.

You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>But the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven.

He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has promised you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>After the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> is going to drive them out before you. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Golden Calf</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>At Horeb you aroused the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed! <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had commanded you. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then once again I fell prostrate before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s sight and so arousing his anger. <sup id="filepos1635377" class="calibre23">19</sup>I feared the anger and wrath of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> listened to me. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>You also made the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>And when the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God. You did not trust him or obey him. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>You have been rebellious against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> ever since I have known you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>I lay prostrate before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> those forty days and forty nights because the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had said he would destroy you. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>I prayed to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and said, “Sovereign <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’ <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>At that time the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> gave them to me. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded me, and they are there now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“Go,” the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.”</span></p>
