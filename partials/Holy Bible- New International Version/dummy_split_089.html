<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10754109" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas<a id="filepos10755365" href="#filepos10782414" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> and stayed with him fifteen days. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>And they praised God because of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised,<a id="filepos10757643" href="#filepos10782771" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> just as Peter had been to the circumcised.<a id="filepos10757771" href="#filepos10783011" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a>
<sup id="filepos10757857" class="calibre23">8</sup>For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. <sup id="filepos10757991" class="calibre23">9</sup>James, Cephas<a id="filepos10758016" href="#filepos10783377" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul Opposes Cephas</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p id="filepos10758598" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10759149" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in<a id="filepos10759830" href="#filepos10783746" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a> Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>“But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?<a id="filepos10761796" href="#filepos10784512" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Have you experienced<a id="filepos10761914" href="#filepos10784903" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> so much in vain—if it really was in vain? <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”<a id="filepos10762295" href="#filepos10785144" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[10]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”<a id="filepos10762739" href="#filepos10785430" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[11]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">9</sup>So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”<a id="filepos10763207" href="#filepos10785836" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[12]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.”<a id="filepos10763424" href="#filepos10786125" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[13]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”<a id="filepos10763646" href="#filepos10786411" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[14]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”<a id="filepos10763893" href="#filepos10786698" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[15]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">14</sup>He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Law and the Promise</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p id="filepos10764328" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”<a id="filepos10764753" href="#filepos10786987" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[16]</sup></span></a> meaning one person, who is Christ. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Children of God</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Before the coming of this faith,<a id="filepos10766324" href="#filepos10787393" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[17]</sup></span></a> we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></p>
