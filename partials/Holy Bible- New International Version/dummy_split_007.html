<p class="calibre25"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it.

And God saw that it was good. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds.

At that time the Canaanites were in the land. <sup id="filepos349849" class="calibre23">7</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring<a id="filepos349958" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos662250" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[56]</sup></span></a> I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, who had appeared to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and called on the name of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>But the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!” <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>and where he had first built an altar.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, like the land of Egypt.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. <sup id="filepos355561" class="calibre23">15</sup>All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring<a id="filepos355637" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos662607" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[57]</sup></span></a> forever. <sup id="filepos355733" class="calibre23">16</sup>I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>.</span></p>

My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.<a id="filepos376249" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos667108" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[72]</sup></span></a> I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>and his son Ishmael was thirteen; <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,<a id="filepos378417" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos667488" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[73]</sup></span></a> do not pass your servant by. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs<a id="filepos379156" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos667733" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[74]</sup></span></a> of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“There, in the tent,” he said.</span></p>
<p id="filepos380029" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’ <sup id="filepos380922" class="calibre23">14</sup>Is anything too hard for the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Abraham Pleads for Sodom</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? <sup id="filepos381911" class="calibre23">18</sup>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.<a id="filepos382033" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos668013" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[75]</sup></span></a>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>.<a id="filepos383055" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos668344" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[76]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>What if there are fifty righteous people in the city?

<p id="filepos383757" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry<a id="filepos389728" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos669142" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[78]</sup></span></a> his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was merciful to them. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,<a id="filepos390991" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos669393" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[79]</sup></span></a> please! <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Your<a id="filepos391103" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos669660" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[80]</sup></span></a> servant has found favor in your<a id="filepos391221" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos669909" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[81]</sup></span></a> eyes, and you<a id="filepos391321" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos670158" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[82]</sup></span></a> have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.<a id="filepos392072" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos670407" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[83]</sup></span></a>)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> out of the heavens. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Lot and His Daughters</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.” <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab<a id="filepos395182" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos670664" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[84]</sup></span></a>; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi<a id="filepos395389" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos670948" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[85]</sup></span></a>; he is the father of the Ammonites<a id="filepos395510" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos671235" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[86]</sup></span></a> of today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.” <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels<a id="filepos399155" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos671603" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[87]</sup></span></a> of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again, <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>for the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Now the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> did for Sarah what he had promised. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Abraham gave the name Isaac<a id="filepos400514" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos671993" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[88]</sup></span></a> to the son Sarah bore him. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.” <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, <sup id="filepos401606" class="calibre23">10</sup>and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. <sup id="filepos401960" class="calibre23">12</sup>But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring<a id="filepos402144" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos672254" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[89]</sup></span></a> will be reckoned. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she<a id="filepos403018" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos672494" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[90]</sup></span></a> began to sob.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Treaty at Beersheba</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Abraham said, “I swear it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>So that place was called Beersheba,<a id="filepos405900" href="dummy_split_008.html#filepos672755" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[91]</sup></span></a> because the two men swore an oath there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the Eternal God. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Abraham Tested</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Here I am,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Yes, my son?” Abraham replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>But the angel of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Here I am,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram<a id="filepos410075" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos673230" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[92]</sup></span></a> caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>So Abraham called that place The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> it will be provided.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The angel of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> called to Abraham from heaven a second time <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>and said, “I swear by myself, declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup id="filepos410895" class="calibre23">17</sup>I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.<a id="filepos413103" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos674342" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[95]</sup></span></a> He said, <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos413369" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The Hittites replied to Abraham, <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos413695" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos414218" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give<a id="filepos414517" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos674958" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[96]</sup></span></a> you the field, and I give<a id="filepos414629" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos675198" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[97]</sup></span></a> you the cave that is in it.

Bury your dead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Ephron answered Abraham, <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels<a id="filepos415459" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos675678" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[99]</sup></span></a> of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos415652" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded <sup id="filepos416198" class="calibre23">18</sup>to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. <sup id="filepos416458" class="calibre23">20</sup>So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Abraham was now very old, and the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had blessed him in every way. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>I want you to swear by the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said. <sup id="filepos418011" class="calibre23">7</sup>“The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring<a id="filepos418241" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos676069" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[100]</sup></span></a> I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim<a id="filepos418994" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos676309" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[101]</sup></span></a> and made his way to the town of Nahor. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then he prayed, “<span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.” <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had made his journey successful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka<a id="filepos421587" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos676566" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[102]</sup></span></a> and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.<a id="filepos421719" href="dummy_split_009.html#filepos676836" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[103]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.” <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Then the man bowed down and worshiped the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>saying, “Praise be to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>“Come, you who are blessed by the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Then tell us,” Laban said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">40</sup>“He replied, ‘The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">42</sup>“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘<span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,” <sup class="calibre23">44</sup>and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has chosen for my master’s son.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">45</sup>“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him.
