<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua<a id="filepos8979628" href="#filepos8990044" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[1]</sup></span></a> son of Jozadak,<a id="filepos8979729" href="#filepos8990323" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a> the high priest:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty says: “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s house.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then the word of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came through the prophet Haggai: <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>“Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Now this is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty. “Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.”</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><p id="filepos8982017" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> their God had sent him. And the people feared the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then Haggai, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s messenger, gave this message of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> to the people: “I am with you,” declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup id="filepos8982815" class="calibre23">14</sup>So the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty, their God, <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.</span></p>

Does it not seem to you like nothing? <sup id="filepos8984330" class="calibre23">4</sup>But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt.

<p id="filepos8984871" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>“This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> came to the prophet Haggai: <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says: <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>The priests answered, “No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“ ‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on<a id="filepos8987541" href="#filepos8991191" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a>—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s temple. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,’ declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s temple was laid.
