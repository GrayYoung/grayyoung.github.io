<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people— <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant,<a id="filepos10853233" href="#filepos10871526" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> who is a faithful minister of Christ on our<a id="filepos10853362" href="#filepos10871764" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a> behalf, <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,<a id="filepos10853844" href="#filepos10872015" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">10</sup>so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you<a id="filepos10854290" href="#filepos10872286" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a> to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Supremacy of the Son of God</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of<a id="filepos10855830" href="#filepos10872536" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[7]</sup></span></a> your evil behavior. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation— <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul’s Labor for the Church</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness— <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre22"><span class="calibre21"><a href="dummy_split_004.html#filepos231896" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10">Colossians 2</span></a></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Spiritual Fullness in Christ</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces<a id="filepos10859223" href="#filepos10872908" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a> of this world rather than on Christ.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh<a id="filepos10859761" href="#filepos10873232" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> was put off when you were circumcised by<a id="filepos10859887" href="#filepos10873695" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[10]</sup></span></a> Christ, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10860181" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you<a id="filepos10860342" href="#filepos10873960" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[11]</sup></span></a> alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.<a id="filepos10860762" href="#filepos10874211" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[12]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Freedom From Human Rules</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10861785" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules: <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>When Christ, who is your<a id="filepos10863204" href="#filepos10874577" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[13]</sup></span></a> life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.<a id="filepos10863662" href="#filepos10874828" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[14]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">7</sup>You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
