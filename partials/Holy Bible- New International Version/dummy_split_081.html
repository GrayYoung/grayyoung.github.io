<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">19</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</span></span>

<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">25</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things,</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</span></span>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: <span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">10</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“Two men went up to the temple to pray,</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>He asked them, <span><span class="calibre46">“What are you discussing together as you walk along?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>They stood still, their faces downcast. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">19</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">“What things?”</span></span> he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He said to them, <span><span class="calibre46">“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></span>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem.
