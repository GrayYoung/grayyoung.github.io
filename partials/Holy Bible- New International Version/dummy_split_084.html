<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart.

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Apostles Persecuted</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>“Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about this new life.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.” <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings! <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">40</sup>His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">41</sup>The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>This proposal pleased the whole group.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me!

But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’<a id="filepos10253042" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10428325" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[20]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</span></p>

So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. <sup id="filepos10254244" class="calibre23">14</sup>After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>“As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then ‘a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.’<a id="filepos10254923" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10428669" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[21]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">19</sup>He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>“At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child.<a id="filepos10255340" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10428957" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[22]</sup></span></a> For three months he was cared for by his family. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>“When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>“But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’<a id="filepos10256653" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10429220" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[23]</sup></span></a>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">37</sup>“This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’<a id="filepos10258636" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10430254" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[26]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">38</sup>He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>“But our ancestors refused to obey him.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, <span><span class="calibre46">“Ananias!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Yes, Lord,” he answered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>The Lord told him, <span><span class="calibre46">“Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> named Saul, for he is praying.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">12</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> him to restore his sight.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>But the Lord said to Ananias, <span><span class="calibre46">“Go!

<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">16</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>and after taking some food, he regained his strength.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Saul in Damascus and Jerusalem</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him, <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews,<a id="filepos10279465" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10433031" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[34]</sup></span></a> but they tried to kill him. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.</span></p>

Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">40</sup>Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span>The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>“Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The voice spoke to him a second time, <span><span class="calibre46">“Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three<a id="filepos10285837" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10433431" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[35]</sup></span></a> men are looking for you. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>So get up and go downstairs.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">44</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup class="calibre23">45</sup>The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. <sup class="calibre23">46</sup>For they heard them speaking in tongues<a id="filepos10290553" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10433731" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[36]</sup></span></a> and praising God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Then Peter said, <sup class="calibre23">47</sup>“Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” <sup class="calibre23">48</sup>So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then I heard a voice telling me, <span><span class="calibre46">‘Get up, Peter.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, <span><span class="calibre46">‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">10</sup>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: <span><span class="calibre46">‘John baptized with</span></span><a id="filepos10293892" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10434097" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[37]</sup></span></a><span><span class="calibre46"> water,</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> but you will be baptized with</span></span><a id="filepos10294095" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10434335" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[38]</sup></span></a><span><span class="calibre46"> the Holy Spirit.’</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">17</sup>So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Church in Antioch</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) <sup id="filepos10296586" class="calibre23">29</sup>The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Peter’s Miraculous Escape From Prison</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“You’re out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. <sup id="filepos10300416" class="calibre23">17</sup>Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,” he said, and then he left for another place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Herod’s Death</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king’s country for their food supply.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.</span></p>

<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">On Cyprus</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>“You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">In Pisidian Antioch</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country; <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>for about forty years he endured their conduct<a id="filepos10306349" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10435055" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[40]</sup></span></a> in the wilderness; <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>All this took about 450 years.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. <sup id="filepos10306784" class="calibre23">21</sup>Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>“From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>“Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>But God raised him from the dead, <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem.

There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>where they continued to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">In Lystra and Derbe</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>“Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>In the past, he let all nations go their own way. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Paul and Barnabas appointed elders<a id="filepos10318778" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10437395" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[48]</sup></span></a> for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia, <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>The apostles and elders met to consider this question. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>No!

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Simon<a id="filepos10322348" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10437809" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[49]</sup></span></a> has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district<a id="filepos10331023" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10439212" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[53]</sup></span></a> of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul and Silas in Prison</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.” <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">37</sup>But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">38</sup>The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. <sup id="filepos10336339" class="calibre23">40</sup>After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city.

<sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.” <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">In Athens</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.” <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: <span><span class="calibre8">TO AN UNKNOWN GOD</span></span>. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’<a id="filepos10342261" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10439907" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[55]</sup></span></a> As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’<a id="filepos10342420" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10440171" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[56]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>“Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.” <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>At that, Paul left the Council. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed.

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">In Corinth</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: <span><span class="calibre46">“Do not be afraid;</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> keep on speaking, do not be silent.</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre46"><sup class="calibre23">10</sup></span></span><span><span class="calibre46">For I am with you,</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">11</sup>So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>“This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.” <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>So he drove them off. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Priscilla, Aquila and Apollos</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p id="filepos10347081" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor<a id="filepos10348470" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10440554" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[57]</sup></span></a> and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10348845" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when<a id="filepos10349870" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10440930" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[58]</sup></span></a> you believed?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“John’s baptism,” they replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues<a id="filepos10350928" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10441170" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[59]</sup></span></a> and prophesied. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>There were about twelve men in all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.” <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?” <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.<a id="filepos10353220" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10441420" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[60]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">20</sup>In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>After all this had happened, Paul decided<a id="filepos10353538" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10441706" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[61]</sup></span></a> to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.” <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Riot in Ephesus</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">35</sup>The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.” <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!” <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>“Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.

<sup class="calibre23">29</sup>I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>“Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: <span><span class="calibre46">‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’</span></span> ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Kos.

We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10365249" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay.

<p id="filepos10367125" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul Arrested</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers. <sup class="calibre23">36</sup>The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul Speaks to the Crowd</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">37</sup>As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Do you speak Greek?” he replied. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>“Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">40</sup>After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic<a id="filepos10372071" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10442720" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[64]</sup></span></a>:</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos10372554" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Then Paul said: <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>“About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, <span><span class="calibre46">‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>“ ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“ <span><span class="calibre46">‘I am Jesus of Nazareth,</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> whom you are persecuting,’</span></span> he replied. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>“ ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“ <span><span class="calibre46">‘Get up,’</span></span> the Lord said, <span><span class="calibre46">‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’</span></span>
<sup class="calibre23">11</sup>My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>“A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>“Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>“When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>and saw the Lord speaking to me. <span><span class="calibre46">‘Quick!’</span></span> he said. <span><span class="calibre46">‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>“ ‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>And when the blood of your martyr<a id="filepos10376490" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10443153" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[65]</sup></span></a> Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>“Then the Lord said to me, <span><span class="calibre46">‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ </span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul the Roman Citizen</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“Yes, I am,” he answered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul Before the Sanhedrin</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.</span></p>

<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.” <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’<a id="filepos10380869" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10443511" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[66]</sup></span></a>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.” <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, <span><span class="calibre46">“Take courage!</span></span><span><span class="calibre46"> As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Plot to Kill Paul</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>More than forty men were involved in this plot. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>So he took him to the commander.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Paul Transferred to Caesarea</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen<a id="filepos10385432" href="dummy_split_085.html#filepos10443801" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[67]</sup></span></a> to go to Caesarea at nine tonight. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He wrote a letter as follows:</span></p>
