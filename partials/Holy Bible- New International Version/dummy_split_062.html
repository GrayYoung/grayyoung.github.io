<p><span><span>Renewal of Ezekiel’s Call as Watchman</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, speak to your people and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman, <sup>3</sup>and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people, <sup>4</sup>then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head. <sup>5</sup>Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning, their blood will be on their own head. If they had heeded the warning, they would have saved themselves. <sup>6</sup>But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone’s life, that person’s life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. <sup>8</sup>When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for<a id="filepos8144675" href="#filepos8277162"><span><sup>[60]</sup></span></a> their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. <sup id="filepos8144822">9</sup>But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>“Son of man, say to the Israelites, ‘This is what you are saying: “Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of<a id="filepos8145249" href="#filepos8277469"><span><sup>[61]</sup></span></a> them. How then can we live?” ’ <sup>11</sup>Say to them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span>, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>“Therefore, son of man, say to your people, ‘If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person’s former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person’s former wickedness will not bring condemnation. The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous.’ <sup>13</sup>If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered; they will die for the evil they have done. <sup>14</sup>And if I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right— <sup>15</sup>if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan, return what they have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil—that person will surely live; they will not die. <sup>16</sup>None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>“Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But it is their way that is not just. <sup>18</sup>If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, they will die for it. <sup>19</sup>And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right, they will live by doing so. <sup>20</sup>Yet you Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But I will judge each of you according to your own ways.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Jerusalem’s Fall Explained</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has fallen!” <sup>22</sup>Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was on me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>Then the word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup>24</sup>“Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’ <sup>25</sup>Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land? <sup>26</sup>You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>“Say this to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague. <sup>28</sup>I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them. <sup>29</sup>Then they will know that I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>“As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.’ <sup>31</sup>My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain. <sup>32</sup>Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice.</span></p>

<p><span><sup>1</sup>“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>2</sup>This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: The enemy said of you, “Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession.” ’ <sup>3</sup>Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: Because they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people’s malicious talk and slander, <sup>4</sup>therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span>: This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you— <sup>5</sup>this is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland.’ <sup>6</sup>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations. <sup>7</sup>Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>“ ‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home. <sup>9</sup>I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown, <sup>10</sup>and I will cause many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel.

<p><span><span>Israel’s Restoration Assured</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>Again the word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup>17</sup>“Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman’s monthly uncleanness in my sight. <sup>18</sup>So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols. <sup>19</sup>I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions. <sup id="filepos8165296">20</sup>And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, ‘These are the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s people, and yet they had to leave his land.’ <sup>21</sup>I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.</span></p>
<p id="filepos8165679"><span><sup>22</sup>“Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone. <sup>23</sup>I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, declares the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span>, when I am proved holy through you before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>“ ‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. <sup>25</sup>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. <sup>26</sup>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. <sup>27</sup>And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. <sup>28</sup>Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. <sup>29</sup>I will save you from all your uncleanness.

Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!</span></p>
<p><span><sup>33</sup>“ ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt. <sup>34</sup>The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it. <sup>35</sup>They will say, “This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.” <sup>36</sup>Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the <span><span>LORD</span></span> have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the <span><span>LORD</span></span> have spoken, and I will do it.’</span></p>
<p><span><sup>37</sup>“This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: Once again I will yield to Israel’s plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep, <sup>38</sup>as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals.

<p><span><span>The Valley of Dry Bones</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The hand of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. <sup>2</sup>He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. <sup>3</sup>He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”</span></p>
<p><span>I said, “Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span>, you alone know.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>4</sup>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>! <sup id="filepos8170522">5</sup>This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says to these bones: I will make breath<a id="filepos8170641" href="#filepos8278417"><span><sup>[63]</sup></span></a> enter you, and you will come to life. <sup id="filepos8170766">6</sup>I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life.

<p><span><sup>7</sup>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. <sup>8</sup>I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’ ” <sup>10</sup>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel.

<p><span><span>One Nation Under One King</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>The word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup>16</sup>“Son of man, take a stick of wood and write on it, ‘Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick of wood, and write on it, ‘Belonging to Joseph (that is, to Ephraim) and all the Israelites associated with him.’ <sup>17</sup>Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>“When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’ <sup>19</sup>say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and of the Israelite tribes associated with him, and join it to Judah’s stick.

<p><span><sup>24</sup>“ ‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd.

<p><span><sup>1</sup>The word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> came to me: <sup>2</sup>“Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of<a id="filepos8176569" href="#filepos8279252"><span><sup>[65]</sup></span></a> Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him <sup>3</sup>and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of<a id="filepos8176835" href="#filepos8279506"><span><sup>[66]</sup></span></a> Meshek and Tubal. <sup>4</sup>I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole army—your horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large and small shields, all of them brandishing their swords. <sup>5</sup>Persia, Cush<a id="filepos8177194" href="#filepos8279761"><span><sup>[67]</sup></span></a> and Put will be with them, all with shields and helmets, <sup>6</sup>also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.</span></p>

<sup>15</sup>The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.<a id="filepos8192650" href="#filepos8285430"><span><sup>[84]</sup></span></a>
<sup>16</sup>The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Outer Court</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. <sup>18</sup>It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. <sup>19</sup>Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits<a id="filepos8193649" href="#filepos8286000"><span><sup>[85]</sup></span></a> on the east side as well as on the north.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The North Gate</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into the outer court. <sup id="filepos8194105">21</sup>Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup>22</sup>Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. <sup id="filepos8194496">23</sup>There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The South Gate</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. <sup id="filepos8195059">25</sup>The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others.

<p><span><span><span>The Gates to the Inner Court</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>28</sup>Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup id="filepos8195916">29</sup>Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around.

<p><span><sup>32</sup>Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup id="filepos8196596">33</sup>Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others.

<p><span><sup>35</sup>Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it.

<p><span><span><span>The Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>38</sup>A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. <sup>39</sup>In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings<a id="filepos8197996" href="#filepos8286848"><span><sup>[87]</sup></span></a> and guilt offerings were slaughtered. <sup>40</sup>By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. <sup>41</sup>So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. <sup>42</sup>There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high.<a id="filepos8198622" href="#filepos8287106"><span><sup>[88]</sup></span></a> On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. <sup>43</sup>And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth<a id="filepos8198862" href="#filepos8287452"><span><sup>[89]</sup></span></a> long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Rooms for the Priests</span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>44</sup>Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one<a id="filepos8199359" href="#filepos8287728"><span><sup>[90]</sup></span></a> at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south<a id="filepos8199530" href="#filepos8288014"><span><sup>[91]</sup></span></a> gate and facing north. <sup>45</sup>He said to me, “The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple, <sup>46</sup>and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> to minister before him.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos8200003"><span><sup>47</sup>Then he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The New Temple</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p id="filepos8200375"><span><sup>48</sup>He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits<a id="filepos8200621" href="#filepos8288270"><span><sup>[92]</sup></span></a> and its projecting walls were<a id="filepos8200737" href="#filepos8288538"><span><sup>[93]</sup></span></a> three cubits<a id="filepos8200836" href="#filepos8288802"><span><sup>[94]</sup></span></a> wide on either side. <sup>49</sup>The portico was twenty cubits<a id="filepos8200986" href="#filepos8289073"><span><sup>[95]</sup></span></a> wide, and twelve<a id="filepos8201089" href="#filepos8289340"><span><sup>[96]</sup></span></a> cubits<a id="filepos8201182" href="#filepos8289598"><span><sup>[97]</sup></span></a> from front to back.

<p id="filepos8202544"><span><sup>3</sup>Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits<a id="filepos8202716" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8292129"><span><sup>[104]</sup></span></a> wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits<a id="filepos8202905" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8292471"><span><sup>[105]</sup></span></a> wide. <sup>4</sup>And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos8203242"><span><sup>5</sup>Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits<a id="filepos8203435" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8292739"><span><sup>[106]</sup></span></a> wide. <sup>6</sup>The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. <sup>7</sup>The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.</span></p>
<p id="filepos8204099"><span><sup>8</sup>I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. <sup id="filepos8204318">9</sup>The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple <sup>10</sup>and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. <sup id="filepos8204525">11</sup>There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around.</span></p>
<p id="filepos8204745"><span><sup>12</sup>The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits<a id="filepos8204897" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8293006"><span><sup>[107]</sup></span></a> wide.

<p id="filepos8205670"><span><sup>15</sup>Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits.</span></p>
<p><span>The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, <sup>16</sup>as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. <sup>17</sup>In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary <sup>18</sup>were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: <sup>19</sup>the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. <sup>20</sup>From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. <sup id="filepos8207106">22</sup>There was a wooden altar three cubits<a id="filepos8207156" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8293945"><span><sup>[110]</sup></span></a> high and two cubits square<a id="filepos8207270" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8294217"><span><sup>[111]</sup></span></a>; its corners, its base<a id="filepos8207380" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8294474"><span><sup>[112]</sup></span></a> and its sides were of wood.

<p><span><span>The Rooms for the Priests</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. <sup>2</sup>The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.<a id="filepos8208773" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8294851"><span><sup>[113]</sup></span></a>

These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north <sup>12</sup>were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>13</sup>Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings<a id="filepos8211294" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8296284"><span><sup>[118]</sup></span></a> and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. <sup>14</sup>Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: <sup>16</sup>He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.<a id="filepos8212038" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8296543"><span><sup>[119]</sup></span></a><sup>,</sup><a id="filepos8212137" href="dummy_split_063.html#filepos8297002"><span><sup>[120]</sup></span></a>

<p><span><sup>5</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions regarding the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.
