<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong— <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,<a id="filepos10449959" href="#filepos10550637" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a> that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. <sup id="filepos10450774" class="calibre23">17</sup>For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,<a id="filepos10450900" href="#filepos10551652" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”<a id="filepos10451056" href="#filepos10551908" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a></span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”<a id="filepos10455517" href="#filepos10552309" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[7]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">7</sup>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>For God does not show favoritism.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Jews and the Law</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”<a id="filepos10458134" href="#filepos10552662" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the<a id="filepos10458732" href="#filepos10553090" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.</span></p>

<sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. <sup id="filepos10472382" class="calibre23">22</sup>This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we<a id="filepos10473276" href="#filepos10557911" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[23]</sup></span></a> have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we<a id="filepos10473515" href="#filepos10558165" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[24]</sup></span></a> boast in the hope of the glory of God. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Not only so, but we<a id="filepos10473672" href="#filepos10558405" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[25]</sup></span></a> also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>perseverance, character; and character, hope. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him! <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with,<a id="filepos10478760" href="#filepos10558761" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[26]</sup></span></a> that we should no longer be slaves to sin— <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10482135" class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.</span></p>
<p id="filepos10482823" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>For when we were in the realm of the flesh,<a id="filepos10483149" href="#filepos10559374" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[28]</sup></span></a> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Law and Sin</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”<a id="filepos10483989" href="#filepos10559766" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[29]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.<a id="filepos10485560" href="#filepos10560120" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[30]</sup></span></a> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature<a id="filepos10486719" href="#filepos10560363" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[31]</sup></span></a> a slave to the law of sin.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.</span></p>
