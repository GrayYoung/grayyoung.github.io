<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s dwelling. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> their God, and they piled them in heaps. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and blessed his people Israel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, and this was done. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and also the consecrated gifts. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> his God. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>In everything that he undertook in the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings<a id="filepos3658095" href="#filepos3728786" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[100]</sup></span></a> of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces<a id="filepos3658414" href="#filepos3729053" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[101]</sup></span></a> of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words: <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:</span></p>
<br class="calibre1"/><div title="indentedprose" class="calibre1">
<blockquote class="calibre26"><p class="calibre33"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>When Hezekiah says, ‘The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,’ he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’?</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre26"><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>“Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand? <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand? <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre34"> </div>
</div>
<br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> God and against his servant Hezekiah. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The king also wrote letters ridiculing the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: “Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world—the work of human hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>And the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>So the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them<a id="filepos3662790" href="#filepos3729298" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[102]</sup></span></a> on every side. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Hezekiah’s Pride, Success and Death</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>But Hezekiah’s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and olive oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook. <sup class="calibre23">31</sup>But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">32</sup>The other events of Hezekiah’s reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David’s descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He did evil in the eyes of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, following the detestable practices of the nations the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had driven out before the Israelites. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>He built altars in the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, of which the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had said, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.” <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>In both courts of the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, he built altars to all the starry hosts. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, arousing his anger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>He took the image he had made and put it in God’s temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses.” <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> had destroyed before the Israelites.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>So the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>In his distress he sought the favor of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>And when he prayed to him, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> is God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then he restored the altar of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> their God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>The other events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.<a id="filepos3670207" href="#filepos3729703" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[103]</sup></span></a>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles and idols. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> his God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the gatekeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>The workers labored faithfully.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: “Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers.” <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah,<a id="filepos3676688" href="#filepos3730402" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[105]</sup></span></a> Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant: <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>“Go and inquire of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>She said to them, “This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me, <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>‘This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made,<a id="filepos3678515" href="#filepos3731503" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[109]</sup></span></a> my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.’ <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, ‘This is what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace.

<p class="calibre6"><span>So they took her answer back to the king.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>He went up to the temple of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>Josiah celebrated the Passover to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s temple. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>: “Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> your God and his people Israel. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>“Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow Israelites, the lay people. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites, doing what the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> commanded through Moses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle—all from the king’s own possessions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials in charge of God’s temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, as it is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>So at that time the entire service of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span> was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, as King Josiah had ordered. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Death of Josiah</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “What quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Necho had said at God’s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, “Take me away; I am badly wounded.” <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>So they took him out of his chariot, put him in his other chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>The other events of Josiah’s reign and his acts of devotion in accordance with what is written in the Law of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>— <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span></p>
