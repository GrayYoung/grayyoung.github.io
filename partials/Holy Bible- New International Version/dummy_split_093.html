You know how we lived among you for your sake. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10879290" class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed—God is our witness. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Instead, we were like young children<a id="filepos10880227" href="#filepos10894490" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> among you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well. <sup id="filepos10880620" class="calibre23">9</sup>Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe. <sup id="filepos10881476" class="calibre23">14</sup>For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit.

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>that each of you should learn to control your own body<a id="filepos10886301" href="#filepos10895117" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a> in a way that is holy and honorable, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.<a id="filepos10886594" href="#filepos10895417" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a> The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. <sup id="filepos10887229" class="calibre23">10</sup>And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10887809" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Therefore encourage one another with these words.</span></p>

<p id="filepos10889634" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>You are all children of the light and children of the day.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Rejoice always, <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>pray continually, <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
