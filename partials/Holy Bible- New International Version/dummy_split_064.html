<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia<a id="filepos8315592" href="#filepos8410774" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[1]</sup></span></a> and put in the treasure house of his god.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king’s service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility— <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.<a id="filepos8316261" href="#filepos8411017" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[2]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king’s table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king’s service.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Among those who were chosen were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Now God had caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel, <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>but the official told Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your<a id="filepos8317348" href="#filepos8411259" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[3]</sup></span></a> food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>“Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.” <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers<a id="filepos8320131" href="#filepos8411665" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[4]</sup></span></a> to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.<a id="filepos8320400" href="#filepos8412094" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[5]</sup></span></a>”</span></p>
<p id="filepos8320528" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Then the astrologers answered the king,<a id="filepos8320642" href="#filepos8412330" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[6]</sup></span></a> “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos8320860" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”</span></p>
<p id="filepos8322079" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>and said:</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Daniel Interprets the Dream</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>“As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>“Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup class="calibre23">33</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">39</sup>“After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <sup class="calibre23">40</sup>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">44</sup>“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <sup class="calibre23">45</sup>This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>“The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">46</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. <sup class="calibre23">47</sup>The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">48</sup>Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup class="calibre23">49</sup>Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.</span></p>

<div class="calibre1">
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Image of Gold and the Blazing Furnace</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,<a id="filepos8332628" href="#filepos8412853" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[7]</sup></span></a> and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>At this time some astrologers<a id="filepos8334225" href="#filepos8413163" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[8]</sup></span></a> came forward and denounced the Jews. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever! <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us<a id="filepos8336092" href="#filepos8413405" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[9]</sup></span></a> from Your Majesty’s hand. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">24</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">28</sup>Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <sup class="calibre23">29</sup>Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale.

<p id="filepos8354950" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.</span></p>

They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">6</sup>So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever! <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>So King Darius put the decree in writing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span>The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. <sup class="calibre23">20</sup>When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>Daniel answered, “May the king live forever! <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. <sup class="calibre23">2</sup>In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. <sup class="calibre23">7</sup>I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>; it took away the daily sacrifice from the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>, and his sanctuary was thrown down. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Because of rebellion, the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s people<a id="filepos8380031" href="#filepos8419857" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[27]</sup></span></a> and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">13</sup>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the <span><span class="calibre8">LORD</span></span>’s people?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">17</sup>As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,”<a id="filepos8381638" href="#filepos8420113" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[28]</sup></span></a> he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">18</sup>While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">19</sup>He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.<a id="filepos8382300" href="#filepos8420552" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[29]</sup></span></a>
<sup class="calibre23">20</sup>The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. <sup class="calibre23">21</sup>The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">23</sup>“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. <sup class="calibre23">25</sup>He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">26</sup>“The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">27</sup>I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.</span></p>

<p class="calibre15"><span><sup class="calibre23">1</sup>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar).

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">2</sup>At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">4</sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, <sup class="calibre23">5</sup>I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">10</sup>A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. <sup class="calibre23">11</sup>He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">12</sup>Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. <sup class="calibre23">14</sup>Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">15</sup>While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>Then one who looked like a man<a id="filepos8395429" href="#filepos8424702" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[43]</sup></span></a> touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak.

<p class="calibre6"><span>When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you?

When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. <sup class="calibre23">3</sup>Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases. <sup class="calibre23">4</sup>After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">5</sup>“The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power. <sup class="calibre23">6</sup>After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power<a id="filepos8398436" href="#filepos8425206" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[44]</sup></span></a> will not last. In those days she will be betrayed, together with her royal escort and her father<a id="filepos8398619" href="#filepos8425450" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[45]</sup></span></a> and the one who supported her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>“One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious. <sup class="calibre23">8</sup>He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone. <sup class="calibre23">9</sup>Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country. <sup class="calibre23">10</sup>His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">11</sup>“Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated. <sup class="calibre23">12</sup>When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant. <sup class="calibre23">13</sup>For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">14</sup>“In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success. <sup class="calibre23">15</sup>Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand. <sup class="calibre23">16</sup>The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it. <sup class="calibre23">17</sup>He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans<a id="filepos8401006" href="#filepos8425715" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[46]</sup></span></a> will not succeed or help him. <sup class="calibre23">18</sup>Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him. <sup class="calibre23">19</sup>After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">20</sup>“His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">21</sup>“He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue. <sup class="calibre23">22</sup>Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed. <sup class="calibre23">23</sup>After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power. <sup class="calibre23">24</sup>When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses—but only for a time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">25</sup>“With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him. <sup class="calibre23">26</sup>Those who eat from the king’s provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle. <sup class="calibre23">27</sup>The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time. <sup class="calibre23">28</sup>The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">29</sup>“At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before. <sup class="calibre23">30</sup>Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.</span></p>
<p id="filepos8403923" class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">31</sup>“His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. <sup class="calibre23">32</sup>With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">33</sup>“Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. <sup class="calibre23">34</sup>When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them. <sup class="calibre23">35</sup>Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The King Who Exalts Himself</span></span></p><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">36</sup>“The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. <sup class="calibre23">37</sup>He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. <sup class="calibre23">38</sup>Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. <sup class="calibre23">39</sup>He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.<a id="filepos8405880" href="#filepos8425958" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[47]</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">40</sup>“At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. <sup class="calibre23">41</sup>He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. <sup class="calibre23">42</sup>He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. <sup class="calibre23">43</sup>He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites<a id="filepos8406693" href="#filepos8426211" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[48]</sup></span></a> in submission. <sup class="calibre23">44</sup>But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. <sup class="calibre23">45</sup>He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at<a id="filepos8406994" href="#filepos8426479" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[49]</sup></span></a> the beautiful holy mountain.

<p class="calibre6"><span><sup class="calibre23">7</sup>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time.<a id="filepos8409172" href="#filepos8427095" class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre23">[51]</sup></span></a> When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”</span></p>
