		<h4>Balaam’s First Message</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” <sup>2</sup>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the <span>LORD</span> will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The <span>LORD</span> put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials. <sup>7</sup>Then Balaam spoke his message:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains.</p>
			<p>‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>How can I curse those whom God has not cursed?</p>
			<p>How can I denounce those whom the <span>LORD</span> has not denounced?</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>From the rocky peaks I see them,  from the heights I view them.</p>
			<p>I see a people who live apart  and do not consider themselves one of the nations.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup>Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel?</p>
			<p>Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>He answered, “Must I not speak what the <span>LORD</span> puts in my mouth?”</p>

		<h4> Balaam’s Second Message </h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup> Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me.” <sup>14</sup>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.”</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>The <span>LORD</span> met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the <span>LORD</span> say?”</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Then he spoke his message:</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>“Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup> God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. </p>
			<p>Does he speak and then not act?</p>
			<p>Does he promise and not fulfill?</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup> I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.</p>
			<p><sup>21</sup>“No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed<a id="filepos1430050" href="#filepos1556838"><sup>[48]</sup></a> in Israel.</p>
			<p>The <span>LORD</span> their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.</p>
			<p><sup>22</sup>God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup>There is no divination against<a id="filepos1431030" href="#filepos1557142"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Jacob, no evil omens against<a id="filepos1431271" href="#filepos1557380"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Israel.</p>
			<p>It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’</p>
			<p><sup>24</sup>The people rise like a lioness;  they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>25</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!” </p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the <span>LORD</span> says?” </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Balaam’s Third Message</h4>
		<p><sup>27</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.” <sup>28</sup>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” <sup>30</sup>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>

	<p>		<sup>1</sup>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the <span>LORD</span> to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness. <sup>2</sup>When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him <sup>3</sup>and he spoke his message:
</p>
	
	<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p> “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, <sup>4</sup>the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty,<a id="filepos1434964" href="#filepos1557736"><sup>[51]</sup></a> who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: </p>
			<p>				<sup>5</sup>“How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel!
</p>
			<p>				<sup>6</sup>“Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the <span>LORD</span>, like cedars beside the waters.
</p>
			<p>				<sup>7</sup>Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water.
</p>
			<p> “Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. </p>
			<p>				<sup>8</sup>“God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
</p>
			<p> They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them. </p>
			<p>				<sup>9</sup>Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse them?
</p>
			<p> “May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!” </p>
</blockquote>
	<p>		<sup>10</sup>Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. <sup>11</sup>Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the <span>LORD</span> has kept you from being rewarded.”
</p>
	<p>		<sup>12</sup>Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, <sup>13</sup>‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the <span>LORD</span>—and I must say only what the <span>LORD</span> says’? <sup>14</sup>Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.”

	<p>		<sup>15</sup>Then he spoke his message:

	<h4> Balaam’s Fifth Message </h4>
	
	<p>		<sup>20</sup>Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message:

		<h4> Moab Seduces Israel </h4>
		
		<p>			<sup>1</sup>While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women, <sup>2</sup>who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods. <sup>3</sup>So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the <span>LORD</span>’s anger burned against them.
</p>
		<p>			<sup>4</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the <span>LORD</span>, so that the <span>LORD</span>’s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”
</p>
		<p>			<sup>5</sup>So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.”
</p>
		<p>			<sup>6</sup>Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <sup>7</sup>When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand <sup>8</sup>and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped; <sup>9</sup>but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
</p>
		<p>			<sup>10</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>11</sup>“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. <sup>12</sup>Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. <sup>13</sup>He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”
</p>
		<p>			<sup>14</sup>The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. <sup>15</sup>And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
</p>
		<p>			<sup>16</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>17</sup>“Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them. <sup>18</sup>They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”</p>

		<h4> The Second Census </h4>
		<p>			<sup>1</sup>After the plague the <span>LORD</span> said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, <sup>2</sup>“Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.” <sup>3</sup>So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said, <sup>4</sup>“Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.”

The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah’s followers when they rebelled against the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>10</sup>The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men.

He was not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, but he died for his own sin and left no sons. <sup>4</sup>Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>5</sup>So Moses brought their case before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, <sup>6</sup>and the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to him, <sup>7</sup>“What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>8</sup>“Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter. <sup>9</sup>If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. <sup>10</sup>If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. <sup>11</sup>If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the Israelites, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.’ ”</span>

			<span><sup>12</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites. <sup>13</sup>After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was, <sup>14</sup>for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.” (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>15</sup>Moses said to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, <sup>16</sup>“May the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community <sup>17</sup>to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>18</sup>So the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership,<a id="filepos1474550" href="#filepos1561304"><span><sup>[61]</sup></span></a> and lay your hand on him. <sup>19</sup>Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence. <sup>20</sup>Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him. <sup>21</sup>He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>22</sup>Moses did as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly. <sup>23</sup>Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> instructed through Moses.</span>

</p>
		<p>

</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>7</sup>They fought against Midian, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses, and killed every man. <sup>8</sup>Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. <sup>9</sup>The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. <sup>10</sup>They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. <sup>11</sup>They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, <sup>12</sup>and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>13</sup>Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. <sup>14</sup>Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>15</sup>“Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. <sup>16</sup>“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s people. <sup>17</sup>Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, <sup>18</sup>but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>19</sup>“Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. <sup>20</sup>Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>21</sup>Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the <span><span>LORD</span></span> gave Moses: <sup>22</sup>Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead <sup>23</sup>and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. <sup>24</sup>On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.”</span>

			<span><span>Dividing the Spoils</span></span>

		<p>
			<span><sup>25</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, <sup>26</sup>“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured. <sup>27</sup>Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community. <sup>28</sup>From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the <span><span>LORD</span></span> one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep. <sup>29</sup>Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s part. <sup>30</sup>From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s tabernacle.” <sup>31</sup>So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded
			Moses.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>32</sup>The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep, <sup>33</sup>72,000 cattle, <sup>34</sup>61,000 donkeys <sup>35</sup>and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.</span>

		<p>

</p>
</div>
		<p>
			<span><sup>41</sup>Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s part, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>42</sup>The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men— <sup>43</sup>the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep, <sup>44</sup>36,000 cattle, <sup>45</sup>30,500 donkeys <sup>46</sup>and 16,000 people. <sup>47</sup>From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s tabernacle.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>48</sup>Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses <sup>49</sup>and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing. <sup>50</sup>So we have brought as an offering to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.”</span>

			<span><sup>1</sup>The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. <sup>2</sup>So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said, <sup>3</sup>“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— <sup>4</sup>the land the <span><span>LORD</span></span> subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock. <sup>5</sup>If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>6</sup>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here? <sup>7</sup>Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has given them? <sup>8</sup>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. <sup>9</sup>After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had given them. <sup>10</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath: <sup>11</sup>‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— <sup>12</sup>not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the <span><span>LORD</span></span> wholeheartedly.’ <sup>13</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>14</sup>“And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the <span><span>LORD</span></span> even more angry with Israel. <sup>15</sup>If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>16</sup>Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children. <sup>17</sup>But we will arm ourselves for battle<a id="filepos1506389" href="#filepos1567698"><span><sup>[78]</sup></span></a> and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land. <sup>18</sup>We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance. <sup>19</sup>We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>20</sup>Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> for battle <sup>21</sup>and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> until he has driven his enemies out before him— <sup>22</sup>then when the land is subdued before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, you may return and be free from your obligation to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>23</sup>“But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the <span><span>LORD</span></span>; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. <sup>24</sup>Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>25</sup>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands. <sup>26</sup>Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. <sup>27</sup>But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, just as our lord says.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>28</sup>Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. <sup>29</sup>He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession. <sup>30</sup>But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>31</sup>The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has said. <sup>32</sup>We will cross over before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>33</sup>Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>34</sup>The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, <sup>35</sup>Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, <sup>36</sup>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks. <sup>37</sup>And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, <sup>38</sup>as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>39</sup>The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there. <sup>40</sup>So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. <sup>41</sup>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.<a id="filepos1510866" href="#filepos1567980"><span><sup>[79]</sup></span></a> <sup>42</sup>And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.</span>

			<span><span>Inheritance of Zelophehad’s Daughters</span></span>
</p>
		<div> </div>
		<p>
			<span><sup>1</sup>The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families. <sup>2</sup>They said, “When the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. <sup>3</sup>Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away. <sup>4</sup>When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>5</sup>Then at the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: “What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right. <sup>6</sup>This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan. <sup>7</sup>No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors. <sup>8</sup>Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors. <sup>9</sup>No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.”</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>10</sup>So Zelophehad’s daughters did as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses. <sup>11</sup>Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side. <sup>12</sup>They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe and clan.</span>
</p>
		<p>
			<span><sup>13</sup>These are the commands and regulations the <span><span>LORD</span></span> gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</span>
