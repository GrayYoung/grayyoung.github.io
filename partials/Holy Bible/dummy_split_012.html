		<h4>The Burnt Offering</h4>
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said, <sup>2</sup> &quot;Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When anyone among you brings an offering to the <span>LORD</span>, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>3</sup> "'If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you are to offer a male without defect. You must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting so that it will be acceptable to the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>4</sup> You are to lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on your behalf to make atonement for you. <sup>5</sup> You are to slaughter the young bull before the <span>LORD</span>, and then Aaron's sons the priests shall bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <sup>6</sup> You are to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. <sup>7</sup> The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. <sup>8</sup> Then Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. <sup>9</sup> You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to
			burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the <span>LORD</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>10</sup> "'If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the sheep or the goats, you are to offer a male without defect. <sup>11</sup> You are to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the <span>LORD</span>, and Aaron's sons the priests shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>12</sup> You are to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. <sup>13</sup> You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to bring all of them and burn them on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the <span>LORD</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>14</sup> "'If the offering to the <span>LORD</span> is a burnt offering of birds, you are to offer a dove or a young pigeon. <sup>15</sup> The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. <sup>16</sup> He is to remove the crop and the feathers <a id="filepos1032820" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1216892"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and throw them down east of the altar where the ashes are. <sup>17</sup> He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar.

		<h4>The Priests" Share</h4>
		<p>
			<sup>28</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>29</sup> &quot;Say to the Israelites: 'Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the <span>LORD</span> is to bring part of it as their sacrifice to the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>30</sup> With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the <span>LORD</span>; they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering. <sup>31</sup> The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. <sup>32</sup> You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution. <sup>33</sup> The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share. <sup>34</sup> From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual
			share from the Israelites.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>35</sup> This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the <span>LORD</span> that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the <span>LORD</span> as priests. <sup>36</sup> On the day they were anointed, the <span>LORD</span> commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1067903">
			<sup>37</sup> These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering, <sup>38</sup> which the <span>LORD</span> gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the <span>LORD</span>.

		<h4>The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons</h4>
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>2</sup> &quot;Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, <a id="filepos1068989" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1223405"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast, <sup>3</sup> and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting." <sup>4</sup> Moses did as the <span>LORD</span> commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>5</sup> Moses said to the assembly, &quot;This is what the <span>LORD</span> has commanded to be done." <sup>6</sup> Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. <sup>7</sup> He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him. <sup>8</sup> He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. <sup>9</sup> Then he placed the turban on Aaron's head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>10</sup> Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. <sup>11</sup> He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. <sup>12</sup> He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him. <sup>13</sup> Then he brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1070899">
			<sup>14</sup> He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup>15</sup> Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it. <sup>16</sup> Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. <sup>17</sup> But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>18</sup> He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup>19</sup> Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>20</sup> He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. <sup>21</sup> He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span>LORD</span>, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>22</sup> He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup>23</sup> Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup>24</sup> Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>25</sup> After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. <sup>26</sup> And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the <span>LORD</span>, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. <sup>27</sup> He put
			all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering. <sup>28</sup> Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>29</sup> Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>30</sup> Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>31</sup> Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, &quot;Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: 'Aaron and his sons are to eat it." <sup>32</sup> Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread. <sup>33</sup> Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days. <sup>34</sup> What has been done today was commanded by the <span>LORD</span> to make atonement for you. <sup>35</sup> You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the <span>LORD</span> requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>36</sup> So Aaron and his sons did everything the <span>LORD</span> commanded through Moses.

		<h4>The Priests Begin Their Ministry</h4>
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. <sup>2</sup> He said to Aaron, &quot;Take a bull calf for your sin offering <a id="filepos1076168" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1223850"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>3</sup> Then say to the Israelites:'Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb--both a year old and without defect--for a burnt offering, <sup>4</sup> and an ox <a id="filepos1076573" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1224139"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the <span>LORD</span>, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the <span>LORD</span> will appear to you.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>5</sup> They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>6</sup> Then Moses said, &quot;This is what the <span>LORD</span> has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the <span>LORD</span> may appear to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>7</sup> Moses said to Aaron, &quot;Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the <span>LORD</span> has commanded."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. <sup>9</sup> His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. <sup>10</sup> On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses; <sup>11</sup> the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>12</sup> Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. <sup>13</sup> They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. <sup>14</sup> He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>15</sup> Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people鈥s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>16</sup> He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way. <sup>17</sup> He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1079556">
			<sup>18</sup> He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. <sup id="filepos1079791">19</sup> But the fat portions of the ox and the ram--the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver" <sup>20</sup> these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. <sup>21</sup> Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering, as Moses commanded.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>22</sup> Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>23</sup> Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the <span>LORD</span> appeared to all the people. <sup>24</sup> Fire came out from the presence of the <span>LORD</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.

		<h4>The Death of Nadab and Abihu</h4>
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the <span>LORD</span>, contrary to his command. <sup>2</sup> So fire came out from the presence of the <span>LORD</span> and consumed them, and they died before the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>3</sup> Moses then said to Aaron, &quot;This is what the <span>LORD</span> spoke of when he said:
		</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>" 'Among those who approach me I will be proved holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'&quot;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Aaron remained silent.</p>
		<p>
			<sup>4</sup> Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, &quot;Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary." <sup>5</sup> So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>6</sup> Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, &quot;Do not let your hair become unkempt <a id="filepos1083341" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1224666"><sup>[23]</sup></a> and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the <span>LORD</span> will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the <span>LORD</span> has destroyed by fire. <sup>7</sup> Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the <span>LORD</span>'s anointing oil is on you." So they did as Moses said.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> Then the <span>LORD</span> said to Aaron, <sup>9</sup> &quot;You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, <sup>10</sup> so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean, <sup>11</sup> and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the <span>LORD</span> has given them through Moses."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>12</sup> Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, &quot;Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the <span>LORD</span> and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy. <sup>13</sup> Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons" share of the food offerings presented to the <span>LORD</span>; for so I have been commanded. <sup>14</sup> But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites" fellowship offerings. <sup>15</sup> The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the <span>LORD</span> has commanded."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>16</sup> When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering <a id="filepos1085883" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1224926"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked, <sup id="filepos1086088">17</sup> &quot;Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>18</sup> Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded."
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1086508">
			<sup>19</sup> Aaron replied to Moses, &quot;Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the <span>LORD</span>, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the <span>LORD</span> have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?" <sup>20</sup> When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.

		<h4>Regulations About Defiling Skin Diseases</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron, <sup>2</sup> &quot;When anyone has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot on their skin that may be a defiling skin disease, <a id="filepos1097306" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1226325"> <sup>[27]</sup>

			</a> they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons <a id="filepos1097455" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1226789"> <sup>[28]</sup>

			</a> who is a priest. <sup id="filepos1097559">3</sup> The priest is to examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling skin disease. When the priest examines that person, he shall pronounce them ceremonially unclean. <sup>4</sup> If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days. <sup>5</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to examine them, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to isolate them for another seven days. <sup>6</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to examine them again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a rash. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean. <sup>7</sup> But if the rash does spread in their skin after they
			have shown themselves to the priest to be pronounced clean, they must appear before the priest again. <sup>8</sup> The priest is to examine that person, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>9</sup> &quot;When anyone has a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to the priest. <sup>10</sup> The priest is to examine them, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in the swelling, <sup>11</sup> it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce them unclean. He is not to isolate them, because they are already unclean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>12</sup> &quot;If the disease breaks out all over their skin and, so far as the priest can see, it covers all the skin of the affected person from head to foot, <sup>13</sup> the priest is to examine them, and if the disease has covered their whole body, he shall pronounce them clean. Since it has all turned white, they are clean. <sup>14</sup> But whenever raw flesh appears on them, they will be unclean. <sup>15</sup> When the priest sees the raw flesh, he shall pronounce them unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; they have a defiling disease. <sup>16</sup> If the raw flesh changes and turns white, they must go to the priest. <sup>17</sup> The priest is to examine them, and if the sores have turned white, the priest shall pronounce the affected person clean; then they will be clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>18</sup> &quot;When someone has a boil on their skin and it heals, <sup>19</sup> and in the place where the boil was, a white swelling or reddish-white spot appears, they must present themselves to the priest. <sup>20</sup> The priest is to examine it, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce that person unclean. It is a defiling skin disease that has broken out where the boil was. <sup>21</sup> But if, when the priest examines it, there is no white hair in it and it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days. <sup>22</sup> If it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling disease. <sup>23</sup> But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread, it is only a scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce them clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>24</sup> &quot;When someone has a burn on their skin and a reddish-white or white spot appears in the raw flesh of the burn, <sup>25</sup> the priest is to examine the spot, and if the hair in it has turned white, and it appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease. <sup>26</sup> But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and if it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days. <sup>27</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to examine that person, and if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease. <sup>28</sup> If, however, the spot is unchanged and has not spread in the skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a scar from the burn.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>29</sup> &quot;If a man or woman has a sore on their head or chin, <sup>30</sup> the priest is to examine the sore, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease on the head or chin. <sup>31</sup> But if, when the priest examines the sore, it does not seem to be more than skin deep and there is no black hair in it, then the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days. <sup>32</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it and it does not appear to be more than skin deep, <sup>33</sup> then the man or woman must shave themselves, except for the affected area, and the priest is to keep them isolated another seven days. <sup>34</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread in the skin and appears to be no more than skin deep, the priest shall pronounce them
			clean. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean. <sup>35</sup> But if the sore does spread in the skin after they are pronounced clean, <sup>36</sup> the priest is to examine them, and if he finds that the sore has spread in the skin, he does not need to look for yellow hair; they are unclean. <sup>37</sup> If, however, the sore is unchanged so far as the priest can see, and if black hair has grown in it, the affected person is healed. They are clean, and the priest shall pronounce them clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>38</sup> &quot;When a man or woman has white spots on the skin, <sup>39</sup> the priest is to examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; they are clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>40</sup> &quot;A man who has lost his hair and is bald is clean. <sup>41</sup> If he has lost his hair from the front of his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is clean. <sup>42</sup> But if he has a reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is a defiling disease breaking out on his head or forehead. <sup>43</sup> The priest is to examine him, and if the swollen sore on his head or forehead is reddish-white like a defiling skin disease, <sup>44</sup> the man is diseased and is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean because of the sore on his head.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>45</sup> &quot;Anyone with such a defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let their hair be unkempt, <a id="filepos1104988" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1227035"> <sup>[29]</sup>

			</a> cover the lower part of their face and cry out, 'Unclean! Unclean!' <sup>46</sup> As long as they have the disease they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp.

		<h4>Regulations About Defiling Molds</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>47</sup> &quot;As for any fabric that is spoiled with a defiling mold--any woolen or linen clothing, <sup>48</sup> any woven or knitted material of linen or wool, any leather or anything made of leather" <sup>49</sup> if the affected area in the fabric, the leather, the woven or knitted material, or any leather article, is greenish or reddish, it is a defiling mold and must be shown to the priest. <sup>50</sup> The priest is to examine the affected area and isolate the article for seven days. <sup>51</sup> On the seventh day he is to examine it, and if the mold has spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather, whatever its use, it is a persistent defiling mold; the article is unclean. <sup>52</sup> He must burn the fabric, the woven or knitted material of wool or linen, or any leather article that has been spoiled; because the defiling mold is persistent, the article must be burned.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>53</sup> &quot;But if, when the priest examines it, the mold has not spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather article, <sup>54</sup> he shall order that the spoiled article be washed. Then he is to isolate it for another seven days. <sup>55</sup> After the article has been washed, the priest is to examine it again, and if the mold has not changed its appearance, even though it has not spread, it is unclean. Burn it, no matter which side of the fabric has been spoiled. <sup>56</sup> If, when the priest examines it, the mold has faded after the article has been washed, he is to tear the spoiled part out of the fabric, the leather, or the woven or knitted material. <sup>57</sup> But if it reappears in the fabric, in the woven or knitted material, or in the leather article, it is a spreading mold; whatever has the mold must be burned. <sup>58</sup> Any fabric, woven or knitted material, or any leather article that has been washed and is rid of the mold, must
			be washed again. Then it will be clean."
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>59</sup> These are the regulations concerning defiling molds in woolen or linen clothing, woven or knitted material, or any leather article, for pronouncing them clean or unclean.

		<h4>Cleansing From Defiling Skin Diseases</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>2</sup> &quot;These are the regulations for any diseased person at the time of their ceremonial cleansing, when they are brought to the priest: <sup>3</sup> The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease, <a id="filepos1108648" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1227418"> <sup>[30]</sup>

			</a> <sup>4</sup> the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed. <sup>5</sup> Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot. <sup>6</sup> He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. <sup id="filepos1109172">7</sup> Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease, and then pronounce them clean. After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> &quot;The person to be cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair and bathe with water; then they will be ceremonially clean. After this they may come into the camp, but they must stay outside their tent for seven days. <sup>9</sup> On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair; they must shave their head, their beard, their eyebrows and the rest of their hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe themselves with water, and they will be clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>10</sup> &quot;On the eighth day they must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb a year old, each without defect, along with three-tenths of an ephah <a id="filepos1110192" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1228035"> <sup>[31]</sup>

			</a> of oil. <sup>11</sup> The priest who pronounces them clean shall present both the one to be cleansed and their offerings before the <span>LORD</span> at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1110687">
			<sup>12</sup> &quot;Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering. <sup>13</sup> He is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin offering <a id="filepos1111056" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1228830"> <sup>[33]</sup>

			</a> and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy. <sup>14</sup> The priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. <sup id="filepos1111480">15</sup> The priest shall then take some of the log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own left hand, <sup>16</sup> dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of it before the <span>LORD</span> seven times. <sup>17</sup> The priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering. <sup>18</sup> The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for them
			before the <span>LORD</span> .
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1112219">
			<sup>19</sup> &quot;Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from their uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering <sup>20</sup> and offer it on the altar, together with the grain offering, and make atonement for them, and they will be clean.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1112641">
			<sup>21</sup> &quot;If, however, they are poor and cannot afford these, they must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for them, together with a tenth of an ephah <a id="filepos1112898" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1229276"> <sup>[34]</sup>

			</a> of the finest flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of oil, <sup id="filepos1113062">22</sup> and two doves or two young pigeons, such as they can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>23</sup> &quot;On the eighth day they must bring them for their cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the <span>LORD</span> . <sup id="filepos1113479">24</sup> The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering. <sup>25</sup> He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. <sup>26</sup> The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand, <sup>27</sup> and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>28</sup> Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering--on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on

		<p id="filepos1114938">
			<sup>32</sup> These are the regulations for anyone who has a defiling skin disease and who cannot afford the regular offerings for their cleansing.

		<h4>Cleansing From Defiling Molds</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>33</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron, <sup>34</sup> &quot;When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mold in a house in that land, <sup>35</sup> the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, 'I have seen something that looks like a defiling mold in my house." <sup>36</sup> The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mold, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house. <sup>37</sup> He is to examine the mold on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall, <sup>38</sup> the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days. <sup>39</sup> On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mold has spread on the walls, <sup>40</sup> he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and
			thrown into an unclean place outside the town. <sup>41</sup> He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town. <sup>42</sup> Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>43</sup> &quot;If the defiling mold reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered, <sup>44</sup> the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mold has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mold; the house is unclean. <sup>45</sup> It must be torn down--its stones, timbers and all the plaster--and taken out of the town to an unclean place.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>46</sup> &quot;Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening. <sup>47</sup> Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>48</sup> &quot;But if the priest comes to examine it and the mold has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the defiling mold is gone. <sup>49</sup> To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop. <sup>50</sup> He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot. <sup>51</sup> Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times. <sup>52</sup> He shall purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn. <sup>53</sup> Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean."

		<p id="filepos1118520">
			<sup>54</sup> These are the regulations for any defiling skin disease, for a sore, <sup>55</sup> for defiling molds in fabric or in a house, <sup>56</sup> and for a swelling, a rash or a shiny spot, <sup id="filepos1118779">57</sup> to determine when something is clean or unclean.

		<h4>Discharges Causing Uncleanness</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron, <sup>2</sup> &quot;Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When any man has an unusual bodily discharge, such a discharge is unclean. <sup>3</sup> Whether it continues flowing from his body or is blocked, it will make him unclean. This is how his discharge will bring about uncleanness:

			<sup>7</sup> &quot;'Whoever touches the man who has a discharge must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.

		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> &quot;'If the man with the discharge spits on anyone who is clean, they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.

		<p>
			<sup>9</sup> &quot;'Everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean, <sup>10</sup> and whoever touches any of the things that were under him will be unclean till evening; whoever picks up those things must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.

			<sup>11</sup> &quot;'Anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands with water must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.

		<h4>The Day of Atonement</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>2</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses: &quot;Tell your brother Aaron that he is not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark, or else he will die. For I will appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>3</sup> &quot;This is how Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place: He must first bring a young bull for a sin offering <a id="filepos1127569" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1230378"> <sup>[37]</sup>

			</a> and a ram for a burnt offering. <sup>4</sup> He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on. <sup>5</sup> From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>6</sup> &quot;Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household. <sup>7</sup> Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the <span>LORD</span> at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <sup>8</sup> He is to cast lots for the two goats--one lot for the <span>LORD</span> and the other for the scapegoat. <a id="filepos1128575" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1230668"> <sup>[38]</sup>

			</a> <sup>9</sup> Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the <span>LORD</span> and sacrifice it for a sin offering. <sup id="filepos1128802">10</sup> But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the <span>LORD</span> to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>11</sup> &quot;Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering. <sup>12</sup> He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the <span>LORD</span> and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain. <sup>13</sup> He is to put the incense on the fire before the <span>LORD</span> , and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so that he will not die. <sup>14</sup> He is to take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1129986">
			<sup>15</sup> &quot;He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it. <sup id="filepos1130294">16</sup> In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness. <sup>17</sup> No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>18</sup> &quot;Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the <span>LORD</span> and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on all the horns of the altar. <sup>19</sup> He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>20</sup> &quot;When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat. <sup>21</sup> He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites--all their sins--and put them on the goat's head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task. <sup>22</sup> The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>23</sup> &quot;Then Aaron is to go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there. <sup>24</sup> He shall bathe himself with water in the sanctuary area and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people. <sup>25</sup> He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1132627">
			<sup>26</sup> &quot;The man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp. <sup>27</sup> The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh and intestines are to be burned up. <sup>28</sup> The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
		</p>
		<p>

		<h4>Rules for Priests</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: 'A priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean for any of his people who die, <sup>2</sup> except for a close relative, such as his mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother, <sup>3</sup> or an unmarried sister who is dependent on him since she has no husband--for her he may make himself unclean. <sup>4</sup> He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage, <a id="filepos1163370" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1233928"> <sup>[48]</sup>

			</a> and so defile himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>5</sup> &quot;'Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies. <sup>6</sup> They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the <span>LORD</span> , the food of their God, they are to be holy.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>7</sup> &quot;'They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God. <sup>8</sup> Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the <span>LORD</span> am holy--I who make you holy.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>9</sup> &quot;'If a priest's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>10</sup> &quot;'The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt <a id="filepos1164920" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1234199"> <sup>[49]</sup>

			</a> or tear his clothes. <sup>11</sup> He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother, <sup>12</sup> nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the <span>LORD</span> .
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>13</sup> &quot;'The woman he marries must be a virgin. <sup>14</sup> He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from his own people, <sup>15</sup> so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the <span>LORD</span> , who makes him holy.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>16</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>17</sup> &quot;Say to Aaron: 'For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God. <sup>18</sup> No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed; <sup>19</sup> no man with a crippled foot or hand, <sup>20</sup> or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles. <sup>21</sup> No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the food offerings to the <span>LORD</span> . He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God. <sup>22</sup> He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food; <sup>23</sup> yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the <span>LORD</span> , who makes them holy.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>24</sup> So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.

		<sup>10</sup> &quot;'No one outside a priest's family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it. <sup>11</sup> But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if slaves are born in his household, they may eat his food. <sup>12</sup> If a priest's daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred contributions. <sup>13</sup> But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no children, and she returns to live in her father's household as in her youth, she may eat her father's food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it.

		<sup>14</sup> &quot;'Anyone who eats a sacred offering by mistake must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it. <sup>15</sup> The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the <span>LORD</span> <sup>16</sup> by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment.

		<h4>Unacceptable Sacrifices</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>17</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>18</sup> &quot;Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: 'If any of you--whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel--presents a gift for a burnt offering to the <span>LORD</span> , either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, <sup>19</sup> you must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf. <sup>20</sup> Do not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf. <sup>21</sup> When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the <span>LORD</span> to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable. <sup>22</sup> Do not offer to the <span>LORD</span> the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as a food offering presented to the <span>LORD</span>
			. <sup>23</sup> You may, however, present as a freewill offering an ox <a id="filepos1172253" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1234947"> <sup>[51]</sup>

			</a> or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow. <sup>24</sup> You must not offer to the <span>LORD</span> an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land, <sup>25</sup> and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and have defects.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>26</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>27</sup> &quot;When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born, it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>28</sup> Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>29</sup> &quot;When you sacrifice a thank offering to the <span>LORD</span> , sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf. <sup>30</sup> It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it till morning. I am the <span>LORD</span> .
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>31</sup> &quot;Keep my commands and follow them. I am the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>32</sup> Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the <span>LORD</span> , who made you holy <sup>33</sup> and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the <span>LORD</span> ."

		<p>
			<sup>9</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>10</sup> &quot;Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter the land I am going to give you and you reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest. <sup>11</sup> He is to wave the sheaf before the <span>LORD</span> so it will be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath. <sup>12</sup> On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the <span>LORD</span> a lamb a year old without defect, <sup>13</sup> together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah <a id="filepos1177345" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1235344"> <sup>[52]</sup>

		<h4>The Festival of Weeks</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>15</sup> &quot;'From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks. <sup>16</sup> Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup id="filepos1178461">17</sup> From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>18</sup> Present with this bread seven male lambs, each a year old and without defect, one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the <span>LORD</span> , together with their grain offerings and drink offerings--a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>19</sup> Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering <a id="filepos1179073" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1235961"> <sup>[54]</sup>

			</a> and two lambs, each a year old, for a fellowship offering. <sup>20</sup> The priest is to wave the two lambs before the <span>LORD</span> as a wave offering, together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the <span>LORD</span> for the priest. <sup>21</sup> On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work.

			</a> and present a food offering to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>28</sup> Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the <span>LORD</span> your God. <sup id="filepos1181423">29</sup> Those who do not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their people. <sup>30</sup> I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that day. <sup>31</sup> You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live. <sup id="filepos1181730">32</sup> It is a day of sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your sabbath."
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Festival of Tabernacles</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>33</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>34</sup> &quot;Say to the Israelites: 'On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the <span>LORD</span> 's Festival of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts for seven days. <sup>35</sup> The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work. <sup>36</sup> For seven days present food offerings to the <span>LORD</span> , and on the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the <span>LORD</span> . It is the closing special assembly; do no regular work.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1182826">
			<sup>37</sup> (&quot;'These are the <span>LORD</span> 's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for bringing food offerings to the <span>LORD</span> --the burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day. <sup>38</sup> These offerings are in addition to those for the <span>LORD</span> 's Sabbaths and <a id="filepos1183349" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1236599"> <sup>[56]</sup>

			</a> in addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings you give to the <span>LORD</span> .)
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>39</sup> &quot;'So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the <span>LORD</span> for seven days; the first day is a day of sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is a day of sabbath rest. <sup>40</sup> On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees--from palms, willows and other leafy trees--and rejoice before the <span>LORD</span> your God for seven days. <sup>41</sup> Celebrate this as a festival to the <span>LORD</span> for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month. <sup>42</sup> Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters <sup>43</sup> so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the <span>LORD</span> your God.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>44</sup> So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the <span>LORD</span> .

		<h4>Olive Oil and Bread Set Before the LORD</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>2</sup> &quot;Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually. <sup>3</sup> Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the <span>LORD</span> from evening till morning, continually.

			<sup>5</sup> &quot;Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah <a id="filepos1186261" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1237076"> <sup>[57]</sup>

			</a> for each loaf. <sup>6</sup> Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold before the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>7</sup> By each stack put some pure incense as a memorial <a id="filepos1186562" href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos1237356"> <sup>[58]</sup>

			</a> portion to represent the bread and to be a food offering presented to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>8</sup> This bread is to be set out before the <span>LORD</span> regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant. <sup>9</sup> It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the <span>LORD</span> ."

		<h4>A Blasphemer Put to Death</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>10</sup> Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite. <sup>11</sup> The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.) <sup>12</sup> They put him in custody until the will of the <span>LORD</span> should be made clear to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>13</sup> Then the <span>LORD</span> said to Moses: <sup>14</sup> &quot;Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him. <sup>15</sup> Say to the Israelites: 'Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible; <sup>16</sup> anyone who blasphemes the name of the <span>LORD</span> is to be put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>17</sup> &quot;'Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death. <sup>18</sup> Anyone who takes the life of someone's animal must make restitution--life for life. <sup>19</sup> Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner: <sup id="filepos1188944">20</sup> fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury. <sup>21</sup> Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death. <sup>22</sup> You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the <span>LORD</span> your God.'&quot;</p>
		<p>
			<sup>23</sup> Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the <span>LORD</span> commanded Moses.

		<h4>The Sabbath Year</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> The <span>LORD</span> said to Moses at Mount Sinai, <sup>2</sup> &quot;Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the <span>LORD</span> . <sup>3</sup> For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. <sup>4</sup> But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the <span>LORD</span> . Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. <sup>5</sup> Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest. <sup>6</sup> Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you--for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, <sup>7</sup> as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.

		<h4>The Year of Jubilee</h4>

		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> &quot;'Count off seven sabbath years--seven times seven years--so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. <sup>9</sup> Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. <sup>10</sup> Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan. <sup>11</sup> The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. <sup>12</sup> For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>13</sup> &quot;'In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>14</sup> &quot;'If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other. <sup>15</sup> You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. <sup>16</sup> When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops. <sup>17</sup> Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the <span>LORD</span> your God.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>18</sup> &quot;'Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. <sup>19</sup> Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. <sup>20</sup> You may ask, &quot;What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?" <sup>21</sup> I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. <sup>22</sup> While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>23</sup> &quot;'The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers. <sup>24</sup> Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
		</p>
		<p id="filepos1194125">
			<sup>25</sup> &quot;'If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold. <sup>26</sup> If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, <sup>27</sup> they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property. <sup>28</sup> But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>29</sup> &quot;'Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it. <sup>30</sup> If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer's descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. <sup>31</sup> But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>32</sup> &quot;'The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess. <sup>33</sup> So the property of the Levites is redeemable--that is, a house sold in any town they hold--and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. <sup>34</sup> But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>35</sup> &quot;'If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you. <sup>36</sup> Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you. <sup>37</sup> You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit. <sup>38</sup> I am the <span>LORD</span> your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>39</sup> &quot;'If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves. <sup>40</sup> They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. <sup>41</sup> Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. <sup>42</sup> Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves. <sup>43</sup> Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God. </p>
		<p>
			<sup>44</sup> &quot;'Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. <sup>45</sup> You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. <sup>46</sup> You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly. </p>
