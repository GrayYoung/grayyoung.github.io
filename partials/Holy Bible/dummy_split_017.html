<p><span><sup>30</sup>You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. <sup>31</sup>Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. <sup>32</sup>Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. <sup>33</sup>A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. <sup>34</sup>The sights you see will drive you mad. <sup>35</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>36</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone. <sup>37</sup>You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will drive you.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>38</sup>You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. <sup>39</sup>You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. <sup>40</sup>You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. <sup>41</sup>You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. <sup>42</sup>Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>43</sup>The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. <sup>44</sup>They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>45</sup>All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. <sup>46</sup>They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. <sup>47</sup>Because you did not serve the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, <sup>48</sup>therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the <span><span>LORD</span></span> sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>49</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand, <sup>50</sup>a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. <sup>51</sup>They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. <sup>52</sup>They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God is giving you.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>53</sup>Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God has given you. <sup>54</sup>Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, <sup>55</sup>and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. <sup>56</sup>The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter <sup>57</sup>the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>58</sup>If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God— <sup>59</sup>the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. <sup>60</sup>He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup>61</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup>62</sup>You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God. <sup>63</sup>Just as it pleased the <span><span>LORD</span></span> to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>64</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known. <sup>65</sup>Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup>66</sup>You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. <sup>67</sup>In the morning you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening, “If only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup>68</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.</span></p>

<div>
<p id="filepos1750607"><span><sup>1</sup>These are the terms of the covenant the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.</span></p>
<p id="filepos1750910"><span><sup>2</sup>Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them:</span></p>
<br/><p><span>Your eyes have seen all that the <span><span>LORD</span></span> did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land. <sup>3</sup>With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders. <sup id="filepos1751372">4</sup>But to this day the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear. <sup>5</sup>Yet the <span><span>LORD</span></span> says, “During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet. <sup>6</sup>You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. <sup>8</sup>We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do. <sup>10</sup>All of you are standing today in the presence of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God—your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, <sup>11</sup>together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. <sup>12</sup>You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God, a covenant the <span><span>LORD</span></span> is making with you this day and sealing with an oath, <sup>13</sup>to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. <sup>14</sup>I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you <sup>15</sup>who are standing here with us today in the presence of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> our God but also with those who are not here today.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. <sup>17</sup>You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. <sup>18</sup>Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the <span><span>LORD</span></span> our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. <sup>20</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will blot out their names from under heaven. <sup>21</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has afflicted it. <sup>23</sup>The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the <span><span>LORD</span></span> overthrew in fierce anger. <sup>24</sup>All the nations will ask: “Why has the <span><span>LORD</span></span> done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt. <sup>26</sup>They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them. <sup>27</sup>Therefore the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book. <sup>28</sup>In furious anger and in great wrath the <span><span>LORD</span></span> uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>The secret things belong to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Prosperity After Turning to the <span><span>LORD</span></span></span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God disperses you among the nations, <sup>2</sup>and when you and your children return to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today, <sup>3</sup>then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will restore your fortunes<a id="filepos1757775" href="#filepos1832691"><span><sup>[38]</sup></span></a> and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you. <sup>4</sup>Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will gather you and bring you back. <sup>5</sup>He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors. <sup>6</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live. <sup>7</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you. <sup>8</sup>You will again obey the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and follow all his commands I am giving you today. <sup>9</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your ancestors, <sup>10</sup>if you obey the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Offer of Life or Death</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. <sup id="filepos1759743">12</sup>It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” <sup id="filepos1759898">13</sup>Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” <sup id="filepos1760050">14</sup>No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. <sup>16</sup>For I command you today to love the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>17</sup>But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, <sup>18</sup>I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live <sup>20</sup>and that you may love the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the <span><span>LORD</span></span> is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Joshua to Succeed Moses</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel: <sup>2</sup>“I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The <span><span>LORD</span></span> has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’ <sup>3</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said. <sup>4</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land. <sup>5</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you. <sup id="filepos1762946">6</sup>Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the <span><span>LORD</span></span> swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance. <sup>8</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Public Reading of the Law</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, and to all the elders of Israel. <sup>10</sup>Then Moses commanded them: “At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, <sup>11</sup>when all Israel comes to appear before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing. <sup>12</sup>Assemble the people—men, women and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God and follow carefully all the words of this law. <sup>13</sup>Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>Israel’s Rebellion Predicted</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses, “Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him.” So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent. <sup>16</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to Moses: “You are going to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them. <sup>17</sup>And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities will come on them, and in that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us?’ <sup>18</sup>And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>“Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them. <sup>20</sup>When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant. <sup>21</sup>And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.” <sup>22</sup>So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, <sup>25</sup>he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>: <sup>26</sup>“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God. There it will remain as a witness against you. <sup>27</sup>For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the <span><span>LORD</span></span> while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die! <sup>28</sup>Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them. <sup>29</sup>For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and arouse his anger by what your hands have made.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Song of Moses</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Death of Moses</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the <span><span>LORD</span></span> showed him the whole land—from Gilead to Dan, <sup>2</sup>all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, <sup>3</sup>the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. <sup>4</sup>Then the <span><span>LORD</span></span> said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>And Moses the servant of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> died there in Moab, as the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had said. <sup>6</sup>He buried him<a id="filepos1817214" href="#filepos1836979"><span><sup>[52]</sup></span></a> in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is. <sup>7</sup>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone. <sup>8</sup>The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit<a id="filepos1817797" href="#filepos1837227"><span><sup>[53]</sup></span></a> of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the <span><span>LORD</span></span> knew face to face, <sup>11</sup>who did all those signs and wonders the <span><span>LORD</span></span> sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land. <sup>12</sup>For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.</span></p>
