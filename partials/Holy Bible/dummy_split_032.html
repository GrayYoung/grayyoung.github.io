<p><span><sup>1</sup>When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Contributions for Worship</span></span></p><div> </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><sup>2</sup>Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s dwelling. <sup>3</sup>The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>4</sup>He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>5</sup>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. <sup>6</sup>The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> their God, and they piled them in heaps. <sup>7</sup>They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month. <sup>8</sup>When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and blessed his people Israel.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; <sup>10</sup>and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the <span><span>LORD</span></span> has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>11</sup>Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, and this was done. <sup>12</sup>Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank. <sup>13</sup>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and also the consecrated gifts. <sup>15</sup>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. <sup>17</sup>And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. <sup>18</sup>They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the <span><span>LORD</span></span> his God. <sup>21</sup>In everything that he undertook in the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. <sup>2</sup>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem, <sup>3</sup>he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him. <sup>4</sup>They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings<a id="filepos3658095" href="#filepos3728786"><span><sup>[100]</sup></span></a> of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said. <sup>5</sup>Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces<a id="filepos3658414" href="#filepos3729053"><span><sup>[101]</sup></span></a> of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>6</sup>He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words: <sup>7</sup>“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. <sup>8</sup>With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the <span><span>LORD</span></span> our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:</span></p>
<br/><div title="indentedprose">
<blockquote><p><span><sup>10</sup>“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? <sup>11</sup>When Hezekiah says, ‘The <span><span>LORD</span></span> our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,’ he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst. <sup>12</sup>Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’?</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span><sup>13</sup>“Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand? <sup>14</sup>Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand? <sup>15</sup>Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”</span></p></blockquote><div> </div>
</div>
<br/><p><span><sup>16</sup>Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the <span><span>LORD</span></span> God and against his servant Hezekiah. <sup>17</sup>The king also wrote letters ridiculing the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: “Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.” <sup>18</sup>Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city. <sup>19</sup>They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world—the work of human hands.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this. <sup>21</sup>And the <span><span>LORD</span></span> sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>So the <span><span>LORD</span></span> saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them<a id="filepos3662790" href="#filepos3729298"><span><sup>[102]</sup></span></a> on every side. <sup>23</sup>Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hezekiah’s Pride, Success and Death</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign. <sup>25</sup>But Hezekiah’s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. <sup>26</sup>Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>27</sup>Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables. <sup>28</sup>He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and olive oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks. <sup>29</sup>He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>30</sup>It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook. <sup>31</sup>But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>32</sup>The other events of Hezekiah’s reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <sup>33</sup>Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David’s descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Manasseh King of Judah</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. <sup>2</sup>He did evil in the eyes of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, following the detestable practices of the nations the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had driven out before the Israelites. <sup>3</sup>He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. <sup>4</sup>He built altars in the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, of which the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had said, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.” <sup>5</sup>In both courts of the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, he built altars to all the starry hosts. <sup>6</sup>He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, arousing his anger.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>He took the image he had made and put it in God’s temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. <sup>8</sup>I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses.” <sup>9</sup>But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the <span><span>LORD</span></span> had destroyed before the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span> spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. <sup>11</sup>So the <span><span>LORD</span></span> brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon. <sup>12</sup>In his distress he sought the favor of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. <sup>13</sup>And when he prayed to him, the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the <span><span>LORD</span></span> is God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city. <sup>16</sup>Then he restored the altar of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel. <sup>17</sup>The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> their God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>18</sup>The other events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.<a id="filepos3670207" href="#filepos3729703"><span><sup>[103]</sup></span></a>
<sup>19</sup>His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself—all these are written in the records of the seers.<a id="filepos3670560" href="#filepos3729975"><span><sup>[104]</sup></span></a>
<sup>20</sup>Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Amon King of Judah</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>21</sup>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. <sup>22</sup>He did evil in the eyes of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made. <sup>23</sup>But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the <span><span>LORD</span></span>; Amon increased his guilt.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>24</sup>Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. <sup>25</sup>Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Josiah’s Reforms</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. <sup>2</sup>He did what was right in the eyes of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and followed the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>3</sup>In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles and idols. <sup>4</sup>Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. <sup>5</sup>He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. <sup>6</sup>In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, <sup>7</sup>he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> his God.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>9</sup>They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the gatekeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup>Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple. <sup>11</sup>They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>12</sup>The workers labored faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites—all who were skilled in playing musical instruments— <sup>13</sup>had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and gatekeepers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Book of the Law Found</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>14</sup>While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> that had been given through Moses. <sup>15</sup>Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>.” He gave it to Shaphan.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: “Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them. <sup>17</sup>They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers.” <sup>18</sup>Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>19</sup>When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes. <sup>20</sup>He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah,<a id="filepos3676688" href="#filepos3730402"><span><sup>[105]</sup></span></a> Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant: <sup>21</sup>“Go and inquire of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s anger that is poured out on us because those who have gone before us have not kept the word of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him<a id="filepos3677461" href="#filepos3730668"><span><sup>[106]</sup></span></a> went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath,<a id="filepos3677629" href="#filepos3730999"><span><sup>[107]</sup></span></a> the son of Hasrah,<a id="filepos3677735" href="#filepos3731251"><span><sup>[108]</sup></span></a> keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>She said to them, “This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me, <sup>24</sup>‘This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah. <sup>25</sup>Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made,<a id="filepos3678515" href="#filepos3731503"><span><sup>[109]</sup></span></a> my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.’ <sup>26</sup>Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, ‘This is what the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: <sup>27</sup>Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>28</sup>Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span>So they took her answer back to the king.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>29</sup>Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <sup>30</sup>He went up to the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>. <sup>31</sup>The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>—to follow the <span><span>LORD</span></span> and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>32</sup>Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>33</sup>Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the <span><span>LORD</span></span> their God. As long as he lived, they did not fail to follow the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of their ancestors.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Josiah Celebrates the Passover</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>Josiah celebrated the Passover to the <span><span>LORD</span></span> in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month. <sup>2</sup>He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>’s temple. <sup>3</sup>He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>: “Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the <span><span>LORD</span></span> your God and his people Israel. <sup>4</sup>Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>5</sup>“Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow Israelites, the lay people. <sup>6</sup>Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites, doing what the <span><span>LORD</span></span> commanded through Moses.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>7</sup>Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle—all from the king’s own possessions.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>8</sup>His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials in charge of God’s temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle. <sup>9</sup>Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>10</sup>The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered. <sup>11</sup>The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals. <sup>12</sup>They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as it is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle. <sup>13</sup>They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people. <sup>14</sup>After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>15</sup>The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>16</sup>So at that time the entire service of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>, as King Josiah had ordered. <sup>17</sup>The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. <sup>18</sup>The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem. <sup>19</sup>This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Death of Josiah</span></span></p><div> </div>
<p><span><sup>20</sup>After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle. <sup>21</sup>But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “What quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”</span></p>
<p><span><sup>22</sup>Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Necho had said at God’s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>23</sup>Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, “Take me away; I am badly wounded.” <sup>24</sup>So they took him out of his chariot, put him in his other chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>25</sup>Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.</span></p>
<p><span><sup>26</sup>The other events of Josiah’s reign and his acts of devotion in accordance with what is written in the Law of the <span><span>LORD</span></span>— <sup>27</sup>all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span></p>

<p><span><sup>15</sup>The <span><span>LORD</span></span>, the God of their ancestors, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place. <sup>16</sup>But they mocked God’s messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the <span><span>LORD</span></span> was aroused against his people and there was no remedy. <sup>17</sup>He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians,<a id="filepos3693413" href="#filepos3733769"><span><sup>[116]</sup></span></a> who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and did not spare young men or young women, the elderly or the infirm.
