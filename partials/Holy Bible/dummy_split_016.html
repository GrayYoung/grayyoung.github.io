	<section>
		<h4>The Command to Leave Horeb</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. <sup>2</sup>(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the <span>LORD</span> had commanded him concerning them. <sup>4</sup>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>The <span>LORD</span> our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain. <sup>7</sup>Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates. <sup>8</sup>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the <span>LORD</span> swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Appointment of Leaders</h4>
		<p><sup>9</sup>At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. <sup>10</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. <sup>11</sup>May the <span>LORD</span>, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised! <sup>12</sup>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself? <sup>13</sup>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. <sup>16</sup>And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. <sup>17</sup>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.” <sup>18</sup>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</p>

		<h4>Spies Sent Out</h4>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Then, as the <span>LORD</span> our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea. <sup>20</sup>Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the <span>LORD</span> our God is giving us. <sup>21</sup>See, the <span>LORD</span> your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the <span>LORD</span>, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe. <sup>24</sup>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it. <sup>25</sup>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the <span>LORD</span> our God is giving us.”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Rebellion Against the <span>LORD</span></h4>
		<p><sup>26</sup>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the <span>LORD</span> your God. <sup>27</sup>You grumbled in your tents and said, “The <span>LORD</span> hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us. <sup>28</sup>Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. <sup>30</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, <sup>31</sup>and in the wilderness. There you saw how the <span>LORD</span> your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>In spite of this, you did not trust in the <span>LORD</span> your God, <sup>33</sup>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</p>
		<p><sup>34</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore: <sup>35</sup>“No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, <sup id="filepos1578052">36</sup>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the <span>LORD</span> wholeheartedly.”</p>
		<p><sup>37</sup>Because of you the <span>LORD</span> became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either. <sup>38</sup>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it. <sup>39</sup>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it. <sup>40</sup>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.<a id="filepos1578953" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1818797"><sup>[1]</sup></a>”</p>
		<p><sup>41</sup>Then you replied, “We have sinned against the <span>LORD</span>. We will go up and fight, as the <span>LORD</span> our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</p>
		<p><sup>42</sup>But the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>43</sup>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the <span>LORD</span>’s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country. <sup>44</sup>The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah. <sup>45</sup>You came back and wept before the <span>LORD</span>, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you. <sup>46</sup>And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.</p>

		<h4>Wanderings in the Wilderness</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea,<a id="filepos1580975" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819168"><sup>[2]</sup></a> as the <span>LORD</span> had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> said to me, <sup>3</sup>“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. <sup>4</sup>Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. <sup>5</sup>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own. <sup>6</sup>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the <span>LORD</span> your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. <sup>11</sup>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites. <sup>12</sup>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the <span>LORD</span> gave them as their possession.)</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>And the <span>LORD</span> said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the <span>LORD</span> had sworn to them. <sup>15</sup>The <span>LORD</span>’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, <sup>17</sup>the <span>LORD</span> said to me, <sup>18</sup>“Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar. <sup>19</sup>When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. <sup>21</sup>They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The <span>LORD</span> destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place. <sup>22</sup>The <span>LORD</span> had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day. <sup>23</sup>And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor<a id="filepos1585646" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819417"><sup>[3]</sup></a> destroyed them and settled in their place.)</p>

		<h4>Defeat of Sihon King of Heshbon</h4>
		<p><sup>24</sup>“Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. <sup>25</sup>This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying, <sup>27</sup>“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left. <sup>28</sup>Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot— <sup>29</sup>as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the <span>LORD</span> our God is giving us.” <sup>30</sup>But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the <span>LORD</span> your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</p>
		<p><sup>31</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz, <sup>33</sup>the <span>LORD</span> our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army. <sup>34</sup>At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed<a id="filepos1588037" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1819655"><sup>[4]</sup></a> them—men, women and children. We left no survivors. <sup>35</sup>But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves. <sup>36</sup>From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The <span>LORD</span> our God gave us all of them. <sup>37</sup>But in accordance with the command of the <span>LORD</span> our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</p>

		<h4>Defeat of Og King of Bashan</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. <sup>2</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>So the <span>LORD</span> our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors. <sup id="filepos1589879">4</sup>At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup>5</sup>All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages. <sup>6</sup>We completely destroyed<a id="filepos1590232" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820157"><sup>[5]</sup></a> them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying<a id="filepos1590377" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820537"><sup>[6]</sup></a> every city—men, women and children. <sup>7</sup>But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. <sup id="filepos1590853">9</sup>(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) <sup>10</sup>We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup>11</sup>(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide.<a id="filepos1591238" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1820917"><sup>[7]</sup></a> It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Division of the Land</h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. <sup>13</sup>The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites. <sup>14</sup>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.<a id="filepos1592208" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1821280"><sup>[8]</sup></a>) <sup>15</sup>And I gave Gilead to Makir. <sup>16</sup>But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. <sup>17</sup>Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>I commanded you at that time: “The <span>LORD</span> your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites. <sup>19</sup>However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, <sup>20</sup>until the <span>LORD</span> gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.”</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan</h4>
		<p><sup>21</sup>At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the <span>LORD</span> your God has done to these two kings. The <span>LORD</span> will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going. <sup>22</sup>Do not be afraid of them; the <span>LORD</span> your God himself will fight for you.”</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>At that time I pleaded with the <span>LORD</span>: <sup>24</sup>“Sovereign <span>LORD</span>, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do? <sup>25</sup>Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>But because of you the <span>LORD</span> was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the <span>LORD</span> said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter. <sup>27</sup>Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. <sup>28</sup>But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” <sup>29</sup>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</p>

		<h4>Obedience Commanded</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the <span>LORD</span>, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. <sup>2</sup>Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God that I give you.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>You saw with your own eyes what the <span>LORD</span> did at Baal Peor. The <span>LORD</span> your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor, <sup>4</sup>but all of you who held fast to the <span>LORD</span> your God are still alive today.</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the <span>LORD</span> my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it. <sup>6</sup>Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” <sup>7</sup>What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the <span>LORD</span> our God is near us whenever we pray to him? <sup>8</sup>And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</p>
		<p><sup>9</sup>Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. <sup>10</sup>Remember the day you stood before the <span>LORD</span> your God at Horeb, when he said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.” <sup>11</sup>You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. <sup>12</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice. <sup>13</sup>He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets. <sup>14</sup>And the <span>LORD</span> directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Idolatry Forbidden</h4>
		<p><sup>15</sup>You saw no form of any kind the day the <span>LORD</span> spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, <sup>16</sup>so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, <sup>17</sup>or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, <sup>18</sup>or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below. <sup>19</sup>And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the <span>LORD</span> your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. <sup>20</sup>But as for you, the <span>LORD</span> took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>The <span>LORD</span> was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as your inheritance. <sup>22</sup>I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land. <sup>23</sup>Be careful not to forget the covenant of the <span>LORD</span> your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the <span>LORD</span> your God has forbidden. <sup id="filepos1600835">24</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the <span>LORD</span> your God and arousing his anger, <sup>26</sup>I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed. <sup>27</sup>The <span>LORD</span> will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the <span>LORD</span> will drive you. <sup>28</sup>There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. <sup>29</sup>But if from there you seek the <span>LORD</span> your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. <sup>30</sup>When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the <span>LORD</span> your God and obey him. <sup>31</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The <span>LORD</span> Is God</h4>
		<p><sup>32</sup>Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of? <sup>33</sup>Has any other people heard the voice of God<a id="filepos1602992" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1821665"><sup>[9]</sup></a> speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived? <sup>34</sup>Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the <span>LORD</span> your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?</p>
		<p><sup>35</sup>You were shown these things so that you might know that the <span>LORD</span> is God; besides him there is no other. <sup>36</sup>From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. <sup>37</sup>Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, <sup>38</sup>to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.</p>
	<p><sup>39</sup>Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the <span>LORD</span> is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other. <sup>40</sup>Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God gives you for all time.</p>

		<h4>Cities of Refuge</h4>
		<p><sup>41</sup>Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, <sup>42</sup>to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life. <sup>43</sup>The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.</p>

		<h4>Introduction to the Law</h4>
	<p><sup>44</sup>This is the law Moses set before the Israelites. <sup>45</sup>These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt <sup>46</sup>and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. <sup>47</sup>They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. <sup>48</sup>This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion<a id="filepos1606156" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1821907"><sup>[10]</sup></a> (that is, Hermon), <sup>49</sup>and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea,<a id="filepos1606346" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1822227"><sup>[11]</sup></a> below the slopes of Pisgah.</p>

		<h4>The Ten Commandments</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Moses summoned all Israel and said:</p>
		<p>Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. <sup>2</sup>The <span>LORD</span> our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. <sup>3</sup>It was not with our ancestors<a id="filepos1607274" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1822608"><sup>[12]</sup></a> that the <span>LORD</span> made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today. <sup>4</sup>The <span>LORD</span> spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain. <sup>5</sup>(At that time I stood between the <span>LORD</span> and you to declare to you the word of the <span>LORD</span>, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>“I am the <span>LORD</span> your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>7</sup>“You shall have no other gods before<a id="filepos1608279" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1822867"><sup>[13]</sup></a> me.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. <sup>9</sup>You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the <span>LORD</span> your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, <sup>10</sup>but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>
			<p><sup>11</sup>“You shall not misuse the name of the <span>LORD</span> your God, for the <span>LORD</span> will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.</p>
			<p><sup>12</sup>“Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you. <sup>13</sup>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, <sup>14</sup>but the seventh day is a sabbath to the <span>LORD</span> your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do. <sup>15</sup>Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the <span>LORD</span> your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.</p>
			<p id="filepos1610351"><sup>16</sup>“Honor your father and your mother, as the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you.</p>
			<p id="filepos1610746"><sup>17</sup>“You shall not murder.</p>
			<p id="filepos1610912"><sup>18</sup>“You shall not commit adultery.</p>
			<p><sup>19</sup>“You shall not steal.</p>
			<p><sup>20</sup>“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</p>
			<p id="filepos1611454"><sup>21</sup>“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>22</sup>These are the commandments the <span>LORD</span> proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. <sup>24</sup>And you said, “The <span>LORD</span> our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them. <sup>25</sup>But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the <span>LORD</span> our God any longer. <sup>26</sup>For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? <sup>27</sup>Go near and listen to all that the <span>LORD</span> our God says. Then tell us whatever the <span>LORD</span> our God tells you. We will listen and obey.”</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>The <span>LORD</span> heard you when you spoke to me, and the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good. <sup>29</sup>Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!</p>
		<p><sup>30</sup>“Go, tell them to return to their tents. <sup>31</sup>But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”</p>
		<p><sup>32</sup>So be careful to do what the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left. <sup>33</sup>Walk in obedience to all that the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.</p>

		<h4>Love the <span>LORD</span> Your God</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>These are the commands, decrees and laws the <span>LORD</span> your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, <sup>2</sup>so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the <span>LORD</span> your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life. <sup>3</sup>Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the <span>LORD</span>, the God of your ancestors, promised you.</p>
		<p id="filepos1615682"><sup>4</sup>Hear, O Israel: The <span>LORD</span> our God, the <span>LORD</span> is one.<a id="filepos1615879" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1823229"><sup>[14]</sup></a> <sup id="filepos1615966">5</sup>Love the <span>LORD</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. <sup>6</sup>These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. <sup>7</sup>Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. <sup>8</sup>Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. <sup>9</sup>Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, <sup>11</sup>houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, <sup>12</sup>be careful that you do not forget the <span>LORD</span>, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</p>
		<p id="filepos1617198"><sup>13</sup>Fear the <span>LORD</span> your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name. <sup>14</sup>Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; <sup>15</sup>for the <span>LORD</span> your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land. <sup id="filepos1617652">16</sup>Do not put the <span>LORD</span> your God to the test as you did at Massah. <sup>17</sup>Be sure to keep the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you. <sup>18</sup>Do what is right and good in the <span>LORD</span>’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the <span>LORD</span> promised on oath to your ancestors, <sup>19</sup>thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the <span>LORD</span> said.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the <span>LORD</span> our God has commanded you?” <sup>21</sup>tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the <span>LORD</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <sup>22</sup>Before our eyes the <span>LORD</span> sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household. <sup>23</sup>But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors. <sup>24</sup>The <span>LORD</span> commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the <span>LORD</span> our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today. <sup>25</sup>And if we are careful to obey all this law before the <span>LORD</span> our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.”</p>

		<h4>Driving Out the Nations</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you— <sup>2</sup>and when the <span>LORD</span> your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally.<a id="filepos1620343" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1823923"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy. <sup>3</sup>Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, <sup>4</sup>for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the <span>LORD</span>’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. <sup>5</sup>This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles<a id="filepos1620933" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1824375"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and burn their idols in the fire. <sup>6</sup>For you are a people holy to the <span>LORD</span> your God. The <span>LORD</span> your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>The <span>LORD</span> did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. <sup>8</sup>But it was because the <span>LORD</span> loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. <sup>9</sup>Know therefore that the <span>LORD</span> your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. <sup>10</sup>But</p>
		<blockquote title="poetry">
			<p>those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;</p>
			<p>he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><sup>11</sup>Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the <span>LORD</span> your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors. <sup>13</sup>He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. <sup>14</sup>You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. <sup>15</sup>The <span>LORD</span> will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you. <sup>16</sup>You must destroy all the peoples the <span>LORD</span> your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?” <sup>18</sup>But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the <span>LORD</span> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. <sup>19</sup>You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the <span>LORD</span> your God brought you out. The <span>LORD</span> your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear. <sup>20</sup>Moreover, the <span>LORD</span> your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished. <sup>21</sup>Do not be terrified by them, for the <span>LORD</span> your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. <sup>22</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you. <sup>23</sup>But the <span>LORD</span> your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. <sup>24</sup>He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. <sup>25</sup>The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the <span>LORD</span> your God. <sup id="filepos1625686">26</sup>Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.</p>

		<h4>Do Not Forget the <span>LORD</span></h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the <span>LORD</span> promised on oath to your ancestors. <sup>2</sup>Remember how the <span>LORD</span> your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. <sup id="filepos1626799">3</sup>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>4</sup>Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. <sup>5</sup>Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the <span>LORD</span> your God disciplines you.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>Observe the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him. <sup>7</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills; <sup>8</sup>a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey; <sup>9</sup>a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the <span>LORD</span> your God for the good land he has given you. <sup>11</sup>Be careful that you do not forget the <span>LORD</span> your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. <sup>12</sup>Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, <sup>13</sup>and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, <sup>14</sup>then your heart will become proud and you will forget the <span>LORD</span> your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. <sup>15</sup>He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. <sup>16</sup>He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you. <sup>17</sup>You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” <sup>18</sup>But remember the <span>LORD</span> your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>If you ever forget the <span>LORD</span> your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. <sup>20</sup>Like the nations the <span>LORD</span> destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the <span>LORD</span> your God.</p>

		<h4>Not Because of Israel’s Righteousness</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky. <sup>2</sup>The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?” <sup>3</sup>But be assured today that the <span>LORD</span> your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the <span>LORD</span> has promised you.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>After the <span>LORD</span> your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The <span>LORD</span> has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the <span>LORD</span> is going to drive them out before you. <sup>5</sup>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the <span>LORD</span> your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. <sup>6</sup>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>The Golden Calf</h4>
		<p><sup>7</sup>Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the <span>LORD</span> your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>8</sup>At Horeb you aroused the <span>LORD</span>’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you. <sup>9</sup>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the <span>LORD</span> had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. <sup>10</sup>The <span>LORD</span> gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the <span>LORD</span> proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the <span>LORD</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. <sup>12</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span> told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.”</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>And the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed! <sup>14</sup>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.”</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. <sup>16</sup>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the <span>LORD</span> your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the <span>LORD</span> had commanded you. <sup>17</sup>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Then once again I fell prostrate before the <span>LORD</span> for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the <span>LORD</span>’s sight and so arousing his anger. <sup id="filepos1635377">19</sup>I feared the anger and wrath of the <span>LORD</span>, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the <span>LORD</span> listened to me. <sup>20</sup>And the <span>LORD</span> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too. <sup>21</sup>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>You also made the <span>LORD</span> angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>And when the <span>LORD</span> sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the <span>LORD</span> your God. You did not trust him or obey him. <sup>24</sup>You have been rebellious against the <span>LORD</span> ever since I have known you.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>I lay prostrate before the <span>LORD</span> those forty days and forty nights because the <span>LORD</span> had said he would destroy you. <sup>26</sup>I prayed to the <span>LORD</span> and said, “Sovereign <span>LORD</span>, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <sup>27</sup>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. <sup>28</sup>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the <span>LORD</span> was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’ <sup>29</sup>But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”</p>

		<h4>Tablets Like the First Ones</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>At that time the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark.<a id="filepos1638458" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1824802"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
		<sup>2</sup>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.”</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. <sup>4</sup>The <span>LORD</span> wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the <span>LORD</span> gave them to me. <sup>5</sup>Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the <span>LORD</span> commanded me, and they are there now.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. <sup>7</sup>From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. <sup>8</sup>At that time the <span>LORD</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the <span>LORD</span>, to stand before the <span>LORD</span> to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today. <sup>9</sup>That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span>LORD</span> is their inheritance, as the <span>LORD</span> your God told them.)</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the <span>LORD</span> listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you. <sup>11</sup>“Go,” the <span>LORD</span> said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.”</p>

		<h4>Fear the <span>LORD</span></h4>
		<p><sup>12</sup>And now, Israel, what does the <span>LORD</span> your God ask of you but to fear the <span>LORD</span> your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the <span>LORD</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul, <sup>13</sup>and to observe the <span>LORD</span>’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>To the <span>LORD</span> your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it. <sup>15</sup>Yet the <span>LORD</span> set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today. <sup>16</sup>Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. <sup>17</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. <sup>18</sup>He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. <sup>19</sup>And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. <sup>20</sup>Fear the <span>LORD</span> your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name. <sup>21</sup>He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. <sup>22</sup>Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the <span>LORD</span> your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.</p>

		<h4>Love and Obey the <span>LORD</span></h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>Love the <span>LORD</span> your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always. <sup>2</sup>Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the <span>LORD</span> your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm; <sup>3</sup>the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; <sup>4</sup>what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea<a id="filepos1644081" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1825165"><sup>[18]</sup></a> as they were pursuing you, and how the <span>LORD</span> brought lasting ruin on them. <sup>5</sup>It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place, <sup>6</sup>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them. <sup>7</sup>But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the <span>LORD</span> has done.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, <sup>9</sup>and so that you may live long in the land the <span>LORD</span> swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. <sup>10</sup>The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden. <sup>11</sup>But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. <sup>12</sup>It is a land the <span>LORD</span> your God cares for; the eyes of the <span>LORD</span> your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.</p>
		<p><sup>13</sup>So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the <span>LORD</span> your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul— <sup>14</sup>then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. <sup>15</sup>I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. <sup>17</sup>Then the <span>LORD</span>’s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the <span>LORD</span> is giving you. <sup>18</sup>Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. <sup>19</sup>Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. <sup>20</sup>Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, <sup>21</sup>so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the <span>LORD</span> swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the <span>LORD</span> your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him— <sup>23</sup>then the <span>LORD</span> will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. <sup>24</sup>Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. <sup>25</sup>No one will be able to stand against you. The <span>LORD</span> your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse— <sup>27</sup>the blessing if you obey the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God that I am giving you today; <sup>28</sup>the curse if you disobey the commands of the <span>LORD</span> your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known. <sup>29</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses. <sup>30</sup>As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal. <sup>31</sup>You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there, <sup>32</sup>be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.</p>

		<h4>The One Place of Worship</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the <span>LORD</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as you live in the land. <sup>2</sup>Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. <sup>3</sup>Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>You must not worship the <span>LORD</span> your God in their way. <sup>5</sup>But you are to seek the place the <span>LORD</span> your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; <sup>6</sup>there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. <sup>7</sup>There, in the presence of the <span>LORD</span> your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the <span>LORD</span> your God has blessed you.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, <sup>9</sup>since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you. <sup>10</sup>But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety. <sup>11</sup>Then to the place the <span>LORD</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>12</sup>And there rejoice before the <span>LORD</span> your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own. <sup>13</sup>Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. <sup>14</sup>Offer them only at the place the <span>LORD</span> will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.</p>
		<p><sup>15</sup>Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the <span>LORD</span> your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it. <sup>16</sup>But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. <sup>17</sup>You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts. <sup>18</sup>Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the <span>LORD</span> your God at the place the <span>LORD</span> your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice before the <span>LORD</span> your God in everything you put your hand to. <sup>19</sup>Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat as much of it as you want. <sup>21</sup>If the place where the <span>LORD</span> your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the <span>LORD</span> has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want. <sup>22</sup>Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat. <sup>23</sup>But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. <sup>24</sup>You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. <sup>25</sup>Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the <span>LORD</span>.</p>
		<p><sup>26</sup>But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the <span>LORD</span> will choose. <sup>27</sup>Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the <span>LORD</span> your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the <span>LORD</span> your God, but you may eat the meat. <sup>28</sup>Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the <span>LORD</span> your God.</p>
		<p><sup>29</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land, <sup>30</sup>and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.” <sup>31</sup>You must not worship the <span>LORD</span> your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the <span>LORD</span> hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.</p>
		<p id="filepos1656835"><sup>32</sup>See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.<a id="filepos1656984" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1825538"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

		<sup>6</sup>You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. <sup>7</sup>However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you. <sup>8</sup>The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud.

		<p><sup>28</sup>At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns, <sup>29</sup>so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the <span>LORD</span> your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.</p>

		<h4>The Year for Canceling Debts</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. <sup>2</sup>This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the <span>LORD</span>’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. <sup>3</sup>You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. <sup>4</sup>However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, <sup>5</sup>if only you fully obey the <span>LORD</span> your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. <sup>6</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.</p>
		<p><sup>7</sup>If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. <sup>8</sup>Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. <sup>9</sup>Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the <span>LORD</span> against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the <span>LORD</span> your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to. <sup id="filepos1668901">11</sup>There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.</p>

		<h4>Freeing Servants</h4>
		<p id="filepos1669227"><sup>12</sup>If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. <sup>13</sup>And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. <sup>14</sup>Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the <span>LORD</span> your God has blessed you. <sup>15</sup>Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the <span>LORD</span> your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you, <sup>17</sup>then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the <span>LORD</span> your God will bless you in everything you do.</p>

		<h4>The Firstborn Animals</h4>
		<p><sup>19</sup>Set apart for the <span>LORD</span> your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep. <sup>20</sup>Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the <span>LORD</span> your God at the place he will choose. <sup>21</sup>If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the <span>LORD</span> your God. <sup>22</sup>You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer. <sup>23</sup>But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.</p>

		<p><sup>14</sup>When you enter the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,” <sup>15</sup>be sure to appoint over you a king the <span>LORD</span> your God chooses. He must be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite. <sup>16</sup>The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the <span>LORD</span> has told you, “You are not to go back that way again.” <sup>17</sup>He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.</p>
		<p><sup>18</sup>When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests. <sup>19</sup>It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the <span>LORD</span> his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees <sup>20</sup>and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.</p>

		<h4>Offerings for Priests and Levites</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the <span>LORD</span>, for that is their inheritance. <sup>2</sup>They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span>LORD</span> is their inheritance, as he promised them.</p>
		<p><sup>3</sup>This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. <sup>4</sup>You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, <sup>5</sup>for the <span>LORD</span> your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the <span>LORD</span>’s name always.</p>
		<p><sup>6</sup>If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the <span>LORD</span> will choose, <sup>7</sup>he may minister in the name of the <span>LORD</span> his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the <span>LORD</span>. <sup>8</sup>He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.</p>

		<h4>Occult Practices</h4>
		<p><sup>9</sup>When you enter the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. <sup>10</sup>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, <sup>11</sup>or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. <sup>12</sup>Anyone who does these things is detestable to the <span>LORD</span>; because of these same detestable practices the <span>LORD</span> your God will drive out those nations before you. <sup>13</sup>You must be blameless before the <span>LORD</span> your God.</p>
	</section>

		<h4>The Prophet</h4>
		<p><sup>14</sup>The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the <span>LORD</span> your God has not permitted you to do so. <sup id="filepos1685402">15</sup>The <span>LORD</span> your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. <sup>16</sup>For this is what you asked of the <span>LORD</span> your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the <span>LORD</span> our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.”</p>
		<p><sup>17</sup>The <span>LORD</span> said to me: “What they say is good. <sup id="filepos1686069">18</sup>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. <sup id="filepos1686244">19</sup>I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. <sup>20</sup>But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.”</p>
		<p><sup>21</sup>You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the <span>LORD</span>?” <sup>22</sup>If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the <span>LORD</span> does not take place or come true, that is a message the <span>LORD</span> has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.</p>

		<h4>Cities of Refuge</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses, <sup>2</sup>then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you to possess. <sup>3</sup>Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities.</p>
		<p><sup>4</sup>This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. <sup>5</sup>For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. <sup>6</sup>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. <sup>7</sup>This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.</p>
		<p><sup>8</sup>If the <span>LORD</span> your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them, <sup>9</sup>because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the <span>LORD</span> your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set aside three more cities. <sup>10</sup>Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.</p>
		<p><sup>11</sup>But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities, <sup>12</sup>the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. <sup>13</sup>Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.</p>
		<p><sup>14</sup>Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you to possess.</p>

		<h4>Witnesses</h4>
		<p id="filepos1690585"><sup>15</sup>One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, <sup>17</sup>the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the <span>LORD</span> before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. <sup>18</sup>The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, <sup id="filepos1691358">19</sup>then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. <sup>20</sup>The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. <sup id="filepos1691619">21</sup>Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p>

		<h4>Going to War</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the <span>LORD</span> your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you. <sup>2</sup>When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army. <sup>3</sup>He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. <sup>4</sup>For the <span>LORD</span> your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.”</p>
		<p><sup>5</sup>The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it. <sup>6</sup>Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it. <sup>7</sup>Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.” <sup>8</sup>Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.” <sup>9</sup>When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it.</p>
		<p><sup>10</sup>When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. <sup>11</sup>If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. <sup>12</sup>If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. <sup>13</sup>When the <span>LORD</span> your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. <sup>14</sup>As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the <span>LORD</span> your God gives you from your enemies. <sup>15</sup>This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.</p>
		<p><sup>16</sup>However, in the cities of the nations the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. <sup>17</sup>Completely destroy<a id="filepos1694911" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1828018"><sup>[25]</sup></a> them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the <span>LORD</span> your God has commanded you. <sup>18</sup>Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the <span>LORD</span> your God.</p>
		<p><sup>19</sup>When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them?<a id="filepos1695704" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1828401"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
		<sup>20</sup>However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.</p>

There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s neck. <sup>5</sup>The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the <span>LORD</span> your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the <span>LORD</span> and to decide all cases of dispute and assault. <sup>6</sup>Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, <sup>7</sup>and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done. <sup>8</sup>Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, <span>LORD</span>, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.” Then the bloodshed will be atoned for, <sup>9</sup>and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the <span>LORD</span>.</p>

		<h4>Marriage Violations</h4>
		<p><sup>13</sup>If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her <sup>14</sup>and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,” <sup>15</sup>then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. <sup>16</sup>Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. <sup>17</sup>Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, <sup>18</sup>and the elders shall take the man and punish him. <sup>19</sup>They shall fine him a hundred shekels<a id="filepos1704946" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1829099"><sup>[28]</sup></a> of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.</p>
		<p><sup>20</sup>If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, <sup id="filepos1705438">21</sup>she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.</p>
		<p><sup>22</sup>If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.</p>
		<p><sup>23</sup>If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, <sup id="filepos1706176">24</sup>you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.</p>
		<p><sup>25</sup>But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die. <sup>26</sup>Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor, <sup>27</sup>for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her.</p>
		<p><sup>28</sup>If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, <sup>29</sup>he shall pay her father fifty shekels<a id="filepos1707250" href="dummy_split_017.html#filepos1829375"><sup>[29]</sup></a> of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.</p>

		<p><sup>19</sup>Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest. <sup>20</sup>You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the <span>LORD</span> your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess.</p>

	<p><sup>1</sup>When people have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty. <sup>2</sup>If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves, <sup>3</sup>but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes.</p>

	<p><sup>5</sup>If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her. <sup>6</sup>The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.</p>
	<p><sup>7</sup>However, if a man does not want to marry his brother’s wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.” <sup>8</sup>Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, “I do not want to marry her,” <sup>9</sup>his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face and say, “This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother’s family line.” <sup>10</sup>That man’s line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.</p>

		<h4>Firstfruits and Tithes</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>When you have entered the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it, <sup>2</sup>take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the <span>LORD</span> your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the <span>LORD</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name <sup>3</sup>and say to the priest in office at the time, “I declare today to the <span>LORD</span> your God that I have come to the land the <span>LORD</span> swore to our ancestors to give us.” <sup>4</sup>The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the <span>LORD</span> your God. <sup>5</sup>Then you shall declare before the <span>LORD</span> your God: “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous. <sup>6</sup>But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor. <sup>7</sup>Then we cried out to the <span>LORD</span>, the God of our ancestors, and the <span>LORD</span> heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression. <sup>8</sup>So the <span>LORD</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. <sup>9</sup>He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey; <sup>10</sup>and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, <span>LORD</span>, have given me.” Place the basket before the <span>LORD</span> your God and bow down before him. <sup>11</sup>Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the <span>LORD</span> your God has given to you and your household.</p>
		<p><sup>12</sup>When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied. <sup>13</sup>Then say to the <span>LORD</span> your God: “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them. <sup>14</sup>I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the <span>LORD</span> my God; I have done everything you commanded me. <sup>15</sup>Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.”</p>

		<h4>Blessings for Obedience</h4>
		<p><sup>1</sup>If you fully obey the <span>LORD</span> your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the <span>LORD</span> your God will set you high above all the nations on earth. <sup>2</sup>All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the <span>LORD</span> your God:</p>
		<blockquote title="indentedprose">
			<p><sup>3</sup>You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup>The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.</p>
