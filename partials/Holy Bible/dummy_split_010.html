					<h4>The Israelites Oppressed</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: <sup>2</sup> Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; <sup>3</sup> Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; <sup>4</sup> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. <sup id="filepos716252">5</sup> The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy <a id="filepos716305" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos986840"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</p>
					<p><sup>6</sup> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, <sup>7</sup> but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.</p>
					<p id="filepos716798"><sup>8</sup> Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. <sup>9</sup> “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. <sup>10</sup> Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”</p>
					<p><sup>11</sup> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. <sup>12</sup> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites <sup>13</sup> and worked them ruthlessly. <sup>14</sup> They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, <sup>16</sup> “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” <sup>17</sup> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. <sup>18</sup> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”</p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. <sup>21</sup> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</p>
					<p><sup>22</sup> Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”</p>

					<h4>The Birth of Moses</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman, <sup>2</sup> and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. <sup>3</sup> But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket <a id="filepos719983" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos987471"><sup>[2]</sup></a> for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. <sup>4</sup> His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</p>
					<p><sup>5</sup> Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. <sup>6</sup> She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.</p>
					<p><sup>7</sup> Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”</p>
					<p><sup>8</sup> “Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother. <sup>9</sup> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him. <sup>10</sup> When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, <a id="filepos721443" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos987800"><sup>[3]</sup></a> saying, “I drew him out of the water.”</p>
				</section>

					<h4>Moses Flees to Midian</h4>
					<p><sup>11</sup> One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. <sup>12</sup> Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. <sup>13</sup> The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”</p>
					<p id="filepos722288"><sup>14</sup> The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well. <sup>16</sup> Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. <sup>17</sup> Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</p>
					<p><sup>18</sup> When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”</p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> “And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”</p>
					<p><sup>21</sup> Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. <sup>22</sup> Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, <a id="filepos724061" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos988080"><sup>[4]</sup></a> saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”</p>
					<p><sup>23</sup> During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. <sup>24</sup> God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. <sup>25</sup> So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</p>

					<h4>Moses and the Burning Bush</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup>2</sup> There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. <sup>3</sup> So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”</p>
					<p><sup>4</sup> When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!”</p>
					<p>And Moses said, “Here I am.”</p>
					<p id="filepos726042"><sup>5</sup> “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” <sup id="filepos726255">6</sup> Then he said, “I am the God of your father, <a id="filepos726316" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos988487"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</p>
					<p id="filepos726570"><sup>7</sup> The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. <sup id="filepos726859">8</sup> So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. <sup>9</sup> And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. <sup id="filepos727251">10</sup> So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”</p>
					<p><sup>11</sup> But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”</p>
					<p><sup>12</sup> And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you <a id="filepos727850" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos988830"><sup>[6]</sup></a> will worship God on this mountain.”</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”</p>
					<p id="filepos728341"><sup>14</sup> God said to Moses, “ I AM WHO I AM . <a id="filepos728493" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos989075"><sup>[7]</sup></a> This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘ I AM has sent me to you.’ ”</p>
					<p id="filepos728744"><sup>15</sup> God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, <a id="filepos728926" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos989369"><sup>[8]</sup></a> the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’</p>
					<blockquote title="poetry">
						<p>“This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><sup>16</sup> “Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD , the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. <sup>17</sup> And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’</p>
					<p><sup>18</sup> “The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD , the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.’ <sup>19</sup> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. <sup>20</sup> So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</p>
					<p><sup>21</sup> “And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. <sup>22</sup> Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”</p>

					<h4>Signs for Moses</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you’?”</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup> Then the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?”</p>
					<p>“A staff,” he replied.</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> The LORD said, “Throw it on the ground.”</p>
					<p>Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. <sup>4</sup> Then the LORD said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand. <sup>5</sup> “This,” said the LORD , “is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”</p>
					<p><sup>6</sup> Then the LORD said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous <a id="filepos733546" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos989934"><sup>[9]</sup></a> —it had become as white as snow.</p>
					<p><sup>7</sup> “Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</p>
					<p><sup>8</sup> Then the LORD said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second. <sup>9</sup> But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> Moses said to the LORD , “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.”</p>
					<p><sup>11</sup> The LORD said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the LORD ? <sup>12</sup> Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.”</p>
					<p><sup>14</sup> Then the LORD ’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you. <sup>15</sup> You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do. <sup>16</sup> He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him. <sup>17</sup> But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.”</p>

					<h4>Moses Returns to Egypt</h4>
					<p><sup>18</sup> Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.”</p>
					<p>Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.” <sup>20</sup> So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</p>
					<p><sup>21</sup> The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. <sup>22</sup> Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, <sup>23</sup> and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses <a id="filepos737868" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos990241"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and was about to kill him. <sup>25</sup> But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it. <a id="filepos738099" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos990483"><sup>[11]</sup></a> “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said. <sup>26</sup> So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)</p>
					<p><sup>27</sup> The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him. <sup>28</sup> Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.</p>
					<p><sup>29</sup> Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites, <sup>30</sup> and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people, <sup>31</sup> and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.</p>

					<h4>Bricks Without Straw</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD , the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup> Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD , that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.”</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”</p>
					<p><sup>4</sup> But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!” <sup>5</sup> Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”</p>
					<p><sup>6</sup> That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: <sup>7</sup> “You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. <sup>8</sup> But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ <sup>9</sup> Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw. <sup>11</sup> Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ” <sup>12</sup> So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. <sup>13</sup> The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.” <sup>14</sup> And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way? <sup>16</sup> Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”</p>
					<p><sup>17</sup> Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD .’ <sup>18</sup> Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.” <sup>20</sup> When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, <sup>21</sup> and they said, “May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”</p>
					<p>God Promises Deliverance</p>
					<p><sup>22</sup> Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? <sup>23</sup> Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”</p>

				<h3><a href="dummy_split_004.html#filepos32318">Exodus 6</a></h3>
				<p><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.”</p>
				<p><sup>2</sup> God also said to Moses, “I am the LORD . <sup>3</sup> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, <a id="filepos745327" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos990879"><sup>[12]</sup></a> but by my name the LORD	<a id="filepos745473" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos991127"><sup>[13]</sup></a> I did not make myself fully known to them. <sup>4</sup> I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners. <sup>5</sup> Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</p>
				<p><sup>6</sup> “Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD , and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. <sup>7</sup> I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. <sup>8</sup> And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD .’ ”</p>
				<p><sup>9</sup> Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.</p>
				<p><sup>10</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, <sup>11</sup> “Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”</p>
				<p><sup>12</sup> But Moses said to the LORD , “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips <a id="filepos747483" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos991421"><sup>[14]</sup></a> ?”</p>

					<h4> Family Record of Moses and Aaron</h4>
					<p><sup>13</sup> Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</p>
					<blockquote title="indentedprose">

					<p><sup>26</sup> It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.” <sup>27</sup> They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.</p>

					<h4>Aaron to Speak for Moses</h4>
					<p><sup>28</sup> Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, <sup>29</sup> he said to him, “I am the LORD . Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.”</p>

				<p><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. <sup>2</sup> You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country. <sup>3</sup> But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt, <sup>4</sup> he will not listen to you.

					<h4> Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Snake</h4>
					<p><sup>8</sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <sup>9</sup> “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. <sup>11</sup> Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: <sup>12</sup> Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. <sup>13</sup> Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4> The Plague of Blood</h4>
					<p><sup>14</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. <sup>15</sup> Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. <sup>16</sup> Then say to him, ‘The LORD , the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. <sup>17</sup> This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD : With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood. <sup>18</sup> The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> The LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels <a id="filepos756839" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos992237"><sup>[16]</sup></a> of wood and stone.”</p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood. <sup>21</sup> The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.</p>
					<p><sup>22</sup> But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. <sup>23</sup> Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart. <sup>24</sup> And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.</p>

					<h4> The Plague of Frogs</h4>

				<p id="filepos758620"><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. <sup>2</sup> If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. <sup>3</sup> The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. <sup>4</sup> The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ”</p>
				<p id="filepos759351"><sup>5</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ”</p>
				<p><sup>6</sup> So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. <sup>7</sup> But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.</p>
				<p><sup>8</sup> Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD .”</p>
				<p><sup>9</sup> Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.”</p>
				<p><sup>10</sup> “Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.</p>
				<p>Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God. <sup>11</sup> The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”</p>
				<p><sup>12</sup> After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. <sup>13</sup> And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields. <sup>14</sup> They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. <sup>15</sup> But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.</p>

					<h4> The Plague of Gnats</h4>
					<p><sup>16</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.” <sup>17</sup> They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. <sup>18</sup> But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not.</p>
					<p>Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, <sup>19</sup> the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4> The Plague of Flies</h4>
					<p><sup>20</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. <sup>21</sup> If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.</p>
					<p><sup>22</sup> “ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD , am in this land. <sup>23</sup> I will make a distinction <a id="filepos764123" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos993023"><sup>[18]</sup></a> between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.</p>
					<p><sup>25</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”</p>
					<p><sup>26</sup> But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us? <sup>27</sup> We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us.”</p>
					<p><sup>28</sup> Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”</p>
					<p><sup>29</sup> Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD , and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD .”</p>
					<p><sup>30</sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD , <sup>31</sup> and the LORD did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained. <sup>32</sup> But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.</p>

					<h4>The Plague on Livestock</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.” <sup>2</sup> If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, <sup>3</sup> the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats. <sup>4</sup> But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>5</sup> The LORD set a time and said, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.” <sup>6</sup> And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. <sup>7</sup> Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.</p>

					<h4>The Plague of Boils</h4>
					<p><sup>8</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. <sup>9</sup> It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. <sup>11</sup> The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians. <sup>12</sup> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>The Plague of Hail</h4>
					<p><sup>13</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me, <sup>14</sup> or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. <sup>15</sup> For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. <sup id="filepos770356">16</sup> But I have raised you up <a id="filepos770393" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos993424"><sup>[19]</sup></a> for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. <sup>17</sup> You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. <sup>18</sup> Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. <sup>19</sup> Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside. <sup>21</sup> But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.</p>
					<p><sup>22</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.” <sup>23</sup> When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt; <sup>24</sup> hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. <sup>25</sup> Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. <sup>26</sup> The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.</p>
					<p><sup>27</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. <sup>28</sup> Pray to the LORD , for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.”</p>
					<p><sup>29</sup> Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD . The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD ’s. <sup>30</sup> But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God.”</p>
					<p><sup>31</sup> (The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom. <sup>32</sup> The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)</p>
					<p><sup>33</sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD ; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. <sup>34</sup> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts. <sup>35</sup> So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.</p>

					<h4>The Plague of Locusts</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them <sup>2</sup> that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD .”</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the LORD , the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. <sup>4</sup> If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. <sup>5</sup> They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields. <sup>6</sup> They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</p>
					<p><sup>7</sup> Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?”</p>
					<p><sup>8</sup> Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”</p>
					<p><sup>9</sup> Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD .”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> Pharaoh said, “The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil. <a id="filepos777428" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos993791"><sup>[20]</sup></a><sup>11</sup> No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD , since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.</p>
					<p><sup>12</sup> And the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; <sup>14</sup> they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. <sup>15</sup> They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</p>
					<p><sup>16</sup> Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. <sup>17</sup> Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”</p>
					<p><sup>18</sup> Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD . <sup>19</sup> And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. <a id="filepos779595" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos994067"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt. <sup>20</sup> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.</p>

					<h4>The Plague of Darkness</h4>
					<p><sup>21</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” <sup>22</sup> So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. <sup>23</sup> No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD . Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.”</p>
					<p><sup>25</sup> But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. <sup>26</sup> Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD .”</p>
					<p><sup>27</sup> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go. <sup>28</sup> Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.”</p>
					<p><sup>29</sup> “Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”</p>

After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely. <sup>2</sup> Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” <sup>3</sup> (The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.)</p>
					<p><sup>4</sup> So Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. <sup>5</sup> Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. <sup>6</sup> There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. <sup>7</sup> But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. <sup>8</sup> All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</p>
					<p><sup>9</sup> The LORD had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.” <sup>10</sup> Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</p>

					<h4>The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, <sup>2</sup> “This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. <sup>3</sup> Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb <a id="filepos785225" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos994436"><sup>[22]</sup></a> for his family, one for each household. <sup id="filepos785352">4</sup> If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. <sup>5</sup> The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. <sup>6</sup> Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. <sup>7</sup> Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. <sup>8</sup> That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. <sup>9</sup> Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs. <sup>10</sup> Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. <sup>11</sup> This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD ’s Passover.</p>
					<p><sup>12</sup> “On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD . <sup>13</sup> The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</p>
					<p><sup>14</sup> “This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD —a lasting ordinance. <sup>15</sup> For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. <sup>16</sup> On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.</p>
					<p><sup>17</sup> “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. <sup>18</sup> In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. <sup>19</sup> For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. <sup>20</sup> Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.”</p>
					<p><sup>21</sup> Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. <sup>22</sup> Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. <sup>23</sup> When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> “Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. <sup>25</sup> When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. <sup>26</sup> And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ <sup>27</sup> then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD , who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped. <sup>28</sup> The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.</p>
					<p><sup>29</sup> At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well. <sup>30</sup> Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.</p>

					<h4>The Exodus</h4>
					<p><sup>31</sup> During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. <sup>32</sup> Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.”</p>
					<p><sup>33</sup> The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!” <sup>34</sup> So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. <sup>35</sup> The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. <sup>36</sup> The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</p>
					<p><sup>37</sup> The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. <sup>38</sup> Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. <sup>39</sup> With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</p>
					<p><sup>40</sup> Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt <a id="filepos792700" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos994782"><sup>[23]</sup></a> was 430 years. <sup>41</sup> At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD ’s divisions left Egypt. <sup>42</sup> Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.</p>

					<h4>Passover Restrictions</h4>
					<p><sup>43</sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal:</p>
					<p>“No foreigner may eat it. <sup>44</sup> Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him, <sup>45</sup> but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it.</p>
					<p id="filepos793875"><sup>46</sup> “It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. <sup>47</sup> The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</p>
					<p><sup>48</sup> “A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the LORD ’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it. <sup>49</sup> The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.”</p>
					
					<p><sup>50</sup> All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. <sup>51</sup> And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.</p>

For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand. <sup>10</sup> You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.</p>
					<p><sup>11</sup> “After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors, <sup id="filepos797443">12</sup> you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb.

					<p><sup>14</sup> “In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. <sup>15</sup> When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’ <sup>16</sup> And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.”</p>

					<h4>Crossing the Sea</h4>
					<p><sup>17</sup> When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” <sup>18</sup> So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. <a id="filepos799168" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos995200"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.” <a id="filepos799636" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos995452"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. <sup>21</sup> By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. <sup>22</sup> Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.</p>

				<h3><a href="dummy_split_004.html#filepos33754">Exodus 14</a></h3>
				<p><sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, <sup>2</sup> “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. <sup>3</sup> Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’ <sup>4</sup> And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD .” So the Israelites did this.</p>
				<p><sup>5</sup> When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!” <sup>6</sup> So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. <sup>7</sup> He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. <sup>8</sup> The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly. <sup>9</sup> The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen <a id="filepos801960" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos995863"><sup>[26]</sup></a> and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.</p>
				<p><sup>10</sup> As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD . <sup>11</sup> They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? <sup>12</sup> Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”</p>
				<p><sup>13</sup> Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. <sup>14</sup> The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”</p>
				<p><sup>15</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. <sup>16</sup> Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. <sup id="filepos803679">17</sup> I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. <sup id="filepos803865">18</sup> The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”</p>
				<p><sup>19</sup> Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, <sup>20</sup> coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.</p>
				<p><sup>21</sup> Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided, <sup>22</sup> and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.</p>
				<p id="filepos804997"><sup>23</sup> The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea. <sup>24</sup> During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. <sup>25</sup> He jammed <a id="filepos805397" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos996412"><sup>[27]</sup></a> the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.”</p>
				<p id="filepos805746"><sup>26</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.” <sup>27</sup> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward <a id="filepos806158" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos996716"><sup>[28]</sup></a> it, and the LORD swept them into the sea. <sup id="filepos806323">28</sup> The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.</p>
				<p><sup>29</sup> But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. <sup>30</sup> That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore. <sup>31</sup> And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.</p>

					<h4>The Waters of Marah and Elim</h4>
					<p id="filepos820673"><sup>22</sup> Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. <sup>23</sup> When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter.

					<h4>Manna and Quail</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt. <sup>2</sup> In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. <sup id="filepos823019">3</sup> The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD ’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.”</p>
					<p id="filepos823351"><sup>4</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions. <sup>5</sup> On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”</p>
					<p id="filepos823864"><sup>6</sup> So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt, <sup>7</sup> and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD , because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?” <sup>8</sup> Moses also said, “You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD .”</p>
					<p><sup>9</sup> Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the LORD , for he has heard your grumbling.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.</p>
					<p><sup>11</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup>12</sup> “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. <sup>14</sup> When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. <sup id="filepos826016">15</sup> When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was.</p>
					<p>Moses said to them, “It is the bread the 		LORD has given you to eat. <sup>16</sup> This is what the 		LORD has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer <a id="filepos826500" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos998742">					<sup>[35]</sup></a> for each person you have in your tent.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>17</sup> The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. <sup id="filepos826823">18</sup> And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.</p>
					<p><sup>19</sup> Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”</p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</p>
					<p><sup>21</sup> Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. <sup>22</sup> On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers <a id="filepos827782" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos999322"><sup>[36]</sup></a> for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses. <sup>23</sup> He said to them, “This is what the LORD commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD . So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. <sup>25</sup> “Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the LORD . You will not find any of it on the ground today. <sup>26</sup> Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”</p>
					<p><sup>27</sup> Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. <sup>28</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you <a id="filepos829112" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos999656"><sup>[37]</sup></a> refuse to keep my commands and my instructions? <sup>29</sup> Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.” <sup>30</sup> So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
					<p><sup>31</sup> The people of Israel called the bread manna. <a id="filepos829704" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos999903"><sup>[38]</sup></a> It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. <sup id="filepos829864">32</sup> Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’ ”</p>
					<p id="filepos830184"><sup>33</sup> So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come.”</p>
					<p><sup>34</sup> As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved. <sup>35</sup> The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.</p>

					<p>Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the 		LORD to the test?”</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”</p>

					<p><sup>5</sup> The LORD answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. <sup>6</sup> I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. <sup>7</sup> And he called the place Massah <a id="filepos833114" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1000373"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and Meribah <a id="filepos833212" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1000633"><sup>[40]</sup></a> because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”</p>

					<h4>The Amalekites Defeated</h4>
					<p><sup>8</sup> The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. <sup>9</sup> Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. <sup>11</sup> As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. <sup>12</sup> When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset. <sup>13</sup> So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.</p>
					<p><sup>14</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.”</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner. <sup>16</sup> He said, “Because hands were lifted up against <a id="filepos835254" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1000897"><sup>[41]</sup></a> the throne of the LORD , <a id="filepos835400" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1001135"><sup>[42]</sup></a> the LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”</p>

					<h4>Jethro Visits Moses</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup> After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her <sup>3</sup> and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, <a id="filepos836501" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1001533"><sup>[43]</sup></a> for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”; <sup>4</sup> and the other was named Eliezer, <a id="filepos836707" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1001825"><sup>[44]</sup></a> for he said, “My father’s God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”</p>
					<p><sup>5</sup> Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. <sup>6</sup> Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”</p>
					<p><sup>7</sup> So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent. <sup>8</sup> Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.</p>
					<p><sup>9</sup> Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. <sup>10</sup> He said, “Praise be to the LORD , who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. <sup>11</sup> Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.” <sup>12</sup> Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. <sup>14</sup> When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will. <sup>16</sup> Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”</p>
					<p><sup>17</sup> Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good. <sup>18</sup> You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. <sup>19</sup> Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him. <sup>20</sup> Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. <sup>21</sup> But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. <sup>22</sup> Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. <sup>23</sup> If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. <sup>25</sup> He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. <sup>26</sup> They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.</p>
					<p><sup>27</sup> Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.</p>

					<h4>At Mount Sinai</h4>
					<p><sup>1</sup> On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai. <sup>2</sup> After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel: <sup>4</sup> ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. <sup>5</sup> Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, <sup>6</sup> you <a id="filepos842743" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1002212"><sup>[45]</sup></a> will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”</p>
					<p><sup>7</sup> So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak. <sup>8</sup> The people all responded together, “We will do everything the LORD has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD .</p>
					<p><sup>9</sup> The LORD said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</p>
					<p><sup>10</sup> And the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes <sup>11</sup> and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. <sup id="filepos844295">12</sup> Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it.

					<p><sup>14</sup> After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. <sup>15</sup> Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”</p>
					<p><sup>16</sup> On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. <sup>17</sup> Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. <sup>18</sup> Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain <a id="filepos845677" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1002506"><sup>[46]</sup></a> trembled violently. <sup>19</sup> As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. <a id="filepos845895" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1002822"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>
					<p><sup>20</sup> The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up <sup>21</sup> and the LORD said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish. <sup>22</sup> Even the priests, who approach the LORD , must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them.”</p>
					<p><sup>23</sup> Moses said to the LORD , “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’ ”</p>
					<p><sup>24</sup> The LORD replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD , or he will break out against them.”</p>
					<p><sup>25</sup> So Moses went down to the people and told them.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p><sup>3</sup> “You shall have no other gods before <a id="filepos848416" href="dummy_split_011.html#filepos1003208"><sup>[48]</sup></a> me.</p>

					<h4> Hebrew Servants</h4>
					<p><sup>2</sup> “If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. <sup>3</sup> If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. <sup>4</sup> If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.</p>

You are to worship at a distance, <sup>2</sup> but Moses alone is to approach the LORD ; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.”</p>
					<p><sup>3</sup> When Moses went and told the people all the LORD ’s words and laws, they responded with one voice, “Everything the LORD has said we will do.” <sup>4</sup> Moses then wrote down everything the LORD had said.</p>
					<p>He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup>5</sup> Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the 		LORD . <sup>6</sup> Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar. <sup>7</sup> Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do everything the 		LORD has said; we will obey.”</p>
					<p id="filepos878044"><sup>8</sup> Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”</p>

Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky. <sup>11</sup> But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.</p>
					<p><sup>12</sup> The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.”</p>
					<p><sup>13</sup> Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God. <sup>14</sup> He said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.”</p>
					<p><sup>15</sup> When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, <sup>16</sup> and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from within the cloud. <sup>17</sup> To the Israelites the glory of the LORD looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain. <sup>18</sup> Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain.
