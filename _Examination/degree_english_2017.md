            article: <p class="pgh-indent">Animals seem to have the sense to eat when they are hungry and they do not eat more than their bodies need. It has been demonstrated that rats will, when given a choice over a period of time, prefer water with vitamins to water without vitamins even though there is no difference in taste or smell between the two water bottles. When a fragrant flavor was added to the vitamin enriched fluid, the rats did seem to develop a taste for it and kept drinking it, even after the vitamins were switched to the clear water. In time, however, they broke the habit and went back to where the necessary vitamins were.</p><p class="pgh-indent">In a classic experiment, babies of 6 to 12 months old were placed in a cafeteria feeding arrangement, with a wide selection of baby food before them. They were given whatever food they pointed to or appeared interested in. We are told that at first they showed some unusual eating patterns, but that over a period of time they managed to select well-balanced diet.</p><p class="pgh-indent">So, in selecting food, rats and babies do seem to know and act on what‘s best for them.Apparently, there is a kind of "body wisdom" . which hmnans soon lose.Most of us do not eat as wisely as we could.</p><p class="pgh-indent">Many of our food preferences are culturally determined and influenced by long-established habits. Some people eat fox, dog and blackbirds, while we eat cows and pigs. So what people eat and how much they eat seem to be greatly influenced by what is going on around them.</p>

            article: <p class="pgh-indent">Suicide has been a cause of concern in most societies for a long time. The classical Greeks, for example, required people who wanted to kill themselves to get permission from the senate. While this law is not without humor by today' s standards, it clearly shows an awareness of the problem in times gone by.</p><p class="pgh-indent">In today' s society, suicide is much more prevalent than we want to admit. Why do people try to take their own lives?</p><p class="pgh-indent">The motives for suicide can be categorized into areas such as a failure, wrath（暴怒）, the needfor attention, stress, and so on. However, the qualities of a person who wants to take his own life change from person to person, making it difficult to depict（描写）the typical victim. To make the problem even more confusing, people will often camouflage（掩盖）their true feelings, thus causing their friends to disregard problems that should be viewed as serious.</p><p class="pgh-indent">In the United States, a network of centers has been created to attempt to prevent suicides.People who are bitter, worded, or depressed are encouraged to contact workers at these centers. These workers, often trained volunteers, offer benevolent advice to the callers, trying to help the callers to see that suicide as a solutions to problems is an illusion. The accomplishments of these centers, insofar（到这个程度）as their effectiveness to reduce suicide is concerned, are minimal However, they have helped a lot of people with a wide variety of problems.So, in the somewhat amorphous（难以名状的）area of man helping his fellow man, they are certainly a success.</p>

            article: <p class="pgh-indent">To swim across the English Channel takes at least nine hours.It's a hard work and it makes you short of breath. To fly over the Channel takes only twenty minutes （as long as you’re not held up at the airport. , but it's an expensive way to travel.You can travel by hovercraft if you don’t mind the noise, and that takes forty minutes. Otherwise you can go by boat, if you forget your sea-sickness ills. All these means of transport have their problems and the weary（不耐烦的）traveler often dreams of being able to drive to France in his own car. “Not possible”, you say, Well, wait a minute.People are once again considering the idea of a Channel tunnel or bridge.</p><p class="pgh-indent">This time, the Greater London Council is looking into the possibility of building a Channel link straight to London. A bridge would cost far more than a tunnel, but you would be able to go by rail or by car on a bridge, whereas a tunnel would provide ar all link only.</p><p class="pgh-indent">Why is this idea being discussed again? Is Britain becoming more conscious of the need for links with Europe as a result of joining the EEC（欧供体）? Well, perhaps.The main reason, though, is that a tunnel or bridge would reach the twenty square kilometers of London's disused dockland（船坞地）. A link from London to the continent would stimulate trade and re-vitalize（使……重新有活力）the port, and would make London a main trading center in Europe. With alink over the Channel, you could buy your fish and chips in England, and be able to eat them in France while they were still warm！</p>

        answer: <h5 class="text-center">How I Finance My College Education</h5><p class="pgh-indent">It is a fact that college is becoming more and more expensive and college life is becoming especially hard for the students who were born in needy families. However, there are several ways in which these students can cover their tuition that their parents are not able to afford. Finding a part-time job, for example, is an ideal way. Besides, one can ask the bank for a loan and repay it when he has the ability. Finally, one can seek assistance from the society.</p><p class="pgh-indent">For me, earning tuition by doing part-time jobs is the most suitable way. First, I learn to be independent both mentally and economically in this way. Apart from this, I no longer need to wor-ry my parents with so heavy a burden. Finally, since I earn my own living, I will be more confi-dent with myself and, therefore, I can live a busy but meaningful college life.</p>
