To say I had lost the thread is putting is mildly.</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[C]</span><span class="col">As I was suffering through my week of anxiety, overthinking the material and guessing my grasp of it, I did some of my own polling among students and professors. David Eisenbach, who teaches a popular class on U.S. presidents at Columbia, prefers the in-class variety. He believes students ultimately learn more and encourages them to form study groups. "That way they socialize over history outside the class, which wouldn't happen without the pressure of an in-class exam," he explained. "Furthermore, in-class exams force students to learn how to perform under pressure, an essential work skill."</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[D]</span><span class="col">He also says there is less chance of cheating with the in-class variety. In 2012, 125 students at Harvard were caught up in scandal when it was discovered they had cheated on a take-home exam for a class entitled "Introduction To Congress." Some colleges have what they call an "honor code." though if you are smart enough to get into these schools, you are either smart enough to get around any codes or hopefully, too ethical to consider doing so. As I sat blocked and clueless for two solid days, I momentarily if I couldn't just call an expert on the subject matter which I was tacking, or someone who took the class previously, to get me going.</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[E]</span><span class="col">Following the Harvard scandal, Mary Miller, the former dean of students at Yale, made an impassioned appeal to her school's professors to refrain from take-home exams. "Students risk health and well being, as well as performance in other end-of-term work, when faculty offers take-home exams without clear, time-limited boundaries," she told me. "Research now shows that regular quizzes, short essays, and other assignments over the course of a term better enhance learning and retention."</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[F]</span><span class="col">Most college prefessors agree the king of exam they choose largely depends on the subject. A quantitative-based one, for example, is unlikely to be sent home, where one could ask their older brothers and sisters to help. Vocational-type classes, such as computer science or journalism, on the other hand, are ofter more research-oriented and lend themselves to take-home testing. Chris Koch, who teaches "History of Broadcast Journalism" at Montgomery Commmunity College in Rockville, Maryland, points out that reporting is about investigation rather than the memorization of minute details. "In my field, it's not what you know——it's what you know how to find out," says Koch. "There is way too much information, and more coming all the time, for anyone to remember. I want my student to search out the answers to questions bu using all the resources available to them."</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[G]</span><span class="col">Students' test-form preferences vary, too, often depending on the subject and course difficulty. "I prefer take-home essays because it is then really about the writing, so you have tmie to edit and do more research," says Elizabeth Dresser, a junior at Barnard. Then there is the stress factor. Francesca Haass, a senior at Middlebury, says, "I find the in-class ones are more stress-ful in the short term, but there is immediate relief as you swallow information like mad, and then you get to forget it all. Take-homes require thoughtful engagement which can lead to longer term stress as there is never a moment when the time is up." Meanwhile, Olivia Rubin, a sophomore at Emory, says she hardly even considers take-homes true exams. "If you understand the material and have the ability to *articulate*(说出) your thoughts, they should be a breeze."</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[H]</span><span class="col">How students ultimately handle tests may depend on their personal test-taking ability. There are people who always wait util the last minute, and make it much harder than it need to be. And then there are those who, not knowing what questions are coming at them, and having no resources to refer to, can freeze. And then there are we rare folks who fit both those descriptions.</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[I]</span><span class="col">Yes, my advanced age must factor into the *equation*(等式), in part because of my inability to access the information as quickly. As another returning student at Columbia, Kate Marber, told me, "We are learning not only all this information, but essentially how to learn again. Our fellow students have just come out of high school. A lot has changed since we were last in school."</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[J]</span><span class="col">If nothing else, the situation has given my college son and me something to share. When I asked him opinion on this matter, he responded, "I like in-class exams because the time is already reserved, as opposed to using my free time at home to work on a test," he responded. It seems to me that a compromise would be receiving the exam questions a day ot two in advance, and then doing the actual test in class with the ticking clock overhead.</span></p><p class="row"><span class="col">[K]</span><span class="col">Better yet, how about what one Hunter College professor reportedly did recently for her final exam&#58; She encouraged the class not to stress or even study, promising that, "It is going to be a piece of cake." When the students came in, sharpened pencils in hand, there was not a blue book in sight. Rather, they saw a large chocolate cake and they each were given a slice.</span></p>

            article: <p>That people often experience trouble sleeping in a different bed in unfamiliar surroundings is a phenomenon known as the "first-night" effect. If a person stays in the same room the following night they tend to sleep more soundly. Yuka Sasaki and her colleagues at Brown University set out to investigate the origins of this effect.</p><p>Dr. Sasaki knew the first-night effect probably has something to do with how humans evolved. The puzzle was what benefit would be gained from it when performance might be affected the following day. She also knew from previous work conducted on birds and dolphins that these animals put half of their brains to sleep at a time so that they can rest while remaining alert enough to avoid *predators*(捕食者). This led her to wonder if people might be doing the same thing. To take a closer look, her team studied 35 healthy people as they slept in the unfamiliar environment of the university's Department of Psychological Sciences. The participants each slept in the department for two nights and were carefully monitored with techniques that looked at the activity of their brains. Dr. Sasaki found, as expected, the participants slept less well on their first night than they did on their second, taking more than twice as long to fall asleep and sleeping less overall. During deep sleep, the participants' brains behaved in a similar manner seen in birds and dolphins. On the first night only, the left *hemispheres*(半球) of their brains did not sleep nearly as deeply as their right hemispheres did.</p><p>Curious if the left hemispheres were indeed remaining awake to process information detected in the surrounding environment, Dr. Sasaki re-ran the experiment while presenting the sleeping participants with a mix of regularly timed *beeps*(蜂鸣声) of the same tone and irregular beeps of a different tone during the night. She worked out that, if the left hemispheres was staying alert to keep guard in a strange environment, then it would react to the irregular beeps by stirring people from sleep and would ignore the regularly timed ones. This is precisely what the found.</p>

          - title: Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
            article: <p>It's time to reevaluate how woman handle conflict at work. Being overworked or over-committed at home and on the job will not get you where you want to be in life. It will only show you down and hinder your career goals.</p><p>Did you know women are more likely than men to feel exhausted? Nearly twice as many women than men ages 18-44 reported feeling "very tired" or "exhausted", according to a recent study.</p><p>This may not be surprising given that this is the age range when women have children. It's also the age range when many women are trying to balance careers and home. One reason women may feel exhausted is that they have a hard time saying "no". Women want to be able to do it all——volunteer for school parties or cook delicious meals——and so their answer to any request is often "Yes, I can."</p><p>Women struggle to say "no" in the workplace for similar reasons, including the desire to be liked by their colleagues. Unfortunately, this inability to say "no" may be hurting women's health as well as their career.</p><p>At the workplace, men use conflict as a way to position themselves, while women often avoid conflict or strive to be the peacemaker, because they don't want to be viewed as aggressive or disruptive at work. For example, there's a problem that needs to be addressed immediately, resulting in a dispute over who should be the one to fix it. Men are more likely to face that dispute from the perspective of what benefits them most, whereas women may approach the same dispute from the perspective of what's the easiest and quickest way to resolve the problem——even if that means doing the boring work themselves.</p><p>This difference in handing conflict could be the deciding factor on who gets promoted to a leadership position and who does not. Leaders have to be able to delegate and manage resources wisely——including staff expertise. Shouldering more of the workload may not earn you that promotion. Instead, it may highlight your inability to delegate effectively.</p>
